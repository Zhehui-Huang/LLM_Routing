"""
Environment Information:

There are ten cities, each with a specified location:

City 1: (9, 4) [Depot]
City 2: (4, 6)
City 3: (4, 4) [Depot]
City 4: (3, 4)
City 5: (4, 8)
City 6: (4, 3)
City 7: (7, 5) [Depot]
City 8: (5, 0)
City 9: (1, 5)
City 10: (9, 3)

There are three depots: City 1, City 3, City 7.
"""

"""
Robot information:

Four robots are available for the task.
All robots start their journeys from the depot (City 3), and the travel cost between any two cities is determined by the Euclidean distance.
All robots can travel between any two cities, except travel between the same city.
All robots have the same amount of energy, which can only allow them to travel at most 11 units of distance.
All robots can recharge at any depot, and the energy will be fully recharged to 11 units after recharging.
"""

###
Task:
All robots need to work together to visit all cities exactly once (depot cities need to be visited at least once), and then back to any depot cities.
The goal is to minimize the maximum tour cost among all robots.
