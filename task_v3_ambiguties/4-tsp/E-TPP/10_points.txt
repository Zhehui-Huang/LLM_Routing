Robot information:

Four robots are available for the task.
All robots start their journeys from the depot (City 3), and the travel cost between any two cities is determined by the 10 times the Euclidean distance between these two cities.
All robots can travel between any two cities, except travel between the same city.
Each robot has its own capacity. Robot A can carry up to 10 units, Robot B can carry up to 15 units, Robot C can carry up to 20 units, and Robot D can carry up to 20 units.
"""

###
Task:
All robots starting their tours from the depot, with the goal of visiting a subset of cities, and all robots must return to the depot after completing their tours of the cities.
Each city can only be visited at most once by any one of the robots.
All robots work together to buy 60 units of product in total.

The goal is to minimize the maximum tour costs (travel cost + purchasing cost) among all robots.
