Environment Information:

There are ten cities, each with a specified location:

City 1: (9, 4)
City 2: (4, 6)
City 3: (4, 4) [Depot]
City 4: (3, 4)
City 5: (4, 8)
City 6: (4, 3)
City 7: (7, 5)
City 8: (5, 0)
City 9: (1, 5)
City 10: (9, 3)

Each city has its own colors. The colors of the cities are as follows:

City 1: ['red', 'green']
City 2: ['yellow', 'blue']
City 3: ['red', 'green', 'yellow', 'blue']  # Depot
City 4: ['red']
City 5: ['green']
City 6: ['yellow']
City 7: ['blue']
City 8: ['red', 'blue']
City 9: ['yellow', 'green']
City 10: ['yellow']

"""
Robot information:

Four robots are available for the task.
All robots start their journeys from the depot (City 3), and the travel cost between any two cities is determined by the Euclidean distance.
All robots can travel between any two cities, except travel between the same city.
Robots are color-coded and can only visit cities matching their color.
The colors of the robots are as follows:
    Robot 1: red
    Robot 2: yellow
    Robot 3: green
    Robot 4: blue

###
Objective:
The goal is to minimize the maximum tour cost among all robots under the given constraints.
Each city must be visited exactly once by one of the robots, and no city should be visited by more than one robot.
Each robot can only visit cities that match its color.

Constraints:
1. Each robot starts its tour from the depot (City 3) and must return to the depot (City 3) after completing its tour.
2. Each robot can only visit cities that match its color.
3. Each city must be visited exactly once by one of the robots, ensuring no city is visited by more than one robot.
4. The objective is to minimize the maximum cost of the tours among all robots.
5. You must use exactly four robots for the task.
6. The travel cost between any two cities is determined by the Euclidean distance.
7. All robots can travel between any two cities, except travel between the same city.
