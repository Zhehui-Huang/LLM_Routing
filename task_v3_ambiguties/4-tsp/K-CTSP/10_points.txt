Environment Information:

There are ten cities, each with a specified location:

City 1: (9, 4)
City 2: (4, 6)
City 3: (4, 4) [Depot]
City 4: (3, 4)
City 5: (4, 8)
City 6: (4, 3)
City 7: (7, 5)
City 8: (5, 0)
City 9: (1, 5)
City 10: (9, 3)

Each city has its own colors. The colors of the cities are as follows:

City 1: ['red', 'green']
City 2: ['yellow', 'blue']
City 3: ['red', 'green', 'yellow', 'blue']  # Depot
City 4: ['red']
City 5: ['green']
City 6: ['yellow']
City 7: ['blue']
City 8: ['red', 'blue']
City 9: ['yellow', 'green']
City 10: ['yellow']
"""

"""
Robot information:

Four robots are available for the task.
All robots start their journeys from the depot (City 3), and the travel cost between any two cities is determined by the Euclidean distance.
All robots can travel between any two cities, except travel between the same city.
Robots are color-coded and can only visit cities matching their color.
The colors of the robots are as follows:
    Robot 1: red
    Robot 2: yellow
    Robot 3: green
    Robot 4: blue
"""

###
Task:
All robots need to work together to visit all cities exactly once, except the starting city, and then back to the starting city.
Each city must be visited exactly once by one of the robots.
Each robot can only visit cities with the same color as itself.

The goal is to minimize the maximum tour cost among all robots.
