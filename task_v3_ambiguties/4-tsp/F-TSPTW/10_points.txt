"""
Environment Information:

There are ten cities, each with a specified location:

City 1: (9, 4)
City 2: (4, 6)
City 3: (4, 4) [Depot]
City 4: (3, 4)
City 5: (4, 8)
City 6: (4, 3)
City 7: (7, 5)
City 8: (5, 0)
City 9: (1, 5)
City 10: (9, 3)
"""

"""
Robot information:

Four robots are available for the task.
All robots start their journeys from the depot (City 3), and the travel cost between any two cities is determined by the Euclidean distance.
All robots can travel between any two cities, except travel between the same city.
All robots travel 1 unit of distance with 1 unit of time.
"""

###
Task:

All robots need to work together to visit all cities exactly once, except the starting cities, and then back to the starting city.
Each city must be visited exactly once by any one of the robots.
Each city must be visited within the time window below:

    City 1: Time window [3, 8]
    City 2: Time window [5, 12]
    City 3: This city is the depot. It can be visited at any time.
    City 4: Time window [0, 4]
    City 5: Time window [1, 10]
    City 6: Time window [1, 5]
    City 7: Time window [1, 10]
    City 8: Time window [3, 6]
    City 9: Time window [2, 6]
    City 10: Time window [7, 11]

The goal is to minimize the maximum tour cost among all robots.
