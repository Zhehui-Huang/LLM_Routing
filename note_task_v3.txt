task_v3/1-tsp/symmetric_edge/euclidean_dist/B-BTSP/

Use following description would make the performance worse.
1. Please find the shortest tour for the robot while minimizing the longest distance between any two consecutive cities in the tour.

You can ask LLMs: is the description clear? Is the objective or task clear?

Does not obey triangle inequality.

For example:

1 -> 4 = 7 > (1 -> 2) + (2 -> 4) = 2 + 3 = 5
5 -> 1 = 6 > (5 -> 3) + (3 -> 1) = 2 + 2 = 4
