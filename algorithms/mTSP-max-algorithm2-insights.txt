Insights from "A General Variable Neighborhood Search Heuristic for mTSP"

Authors: Banu Soylu

Abstract:
This study proposes a general variable neighborhood search heuristic for the mTSP, focusing on minimizing the longest tour length (MinMax mTSP) and the total length of all tours (MinSum mTSP). The effectiveness of this heuristic is demonstrated through tests on literature benchmarks and a real-world application in Kayseri, Turkey, showcasing significant improvements in route optimization.

Key Insights:

1. Heuristic Design:
   - Adapts variable neighborhood search mechanisms for mTSP, using multiple neighborhood structures to optimize solutions.

2. MinMax vs. MinSum Objectives:
   - Addresses both objectives but emphasizes MinMax to balance the workload among salesmen, suitable for equitable route distribution.

3. Real-World Application:
   - Applied to the traffic signalization network in Kayseri, effectively rebalanced tour lengths, leading to more consistent workload distribution.

4. Performance Evaluation:
   - Demonstrated superior performance over existing methods, particularly in reducing the longest tour length, showing efficiency and adaptability.

5. Future Directions:
   - Suggests enhancing the heuristic's efficiency and exploring its applicability to other complex routing and scheduling problems.

These insights provide a solid foundation for understanding the application and benefits of the GVNS heuristic in solving MinMax mTSP problems, offering significant operational improvements in logistics and distribution systems.
