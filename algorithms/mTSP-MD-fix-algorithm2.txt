\subsection*{Initialization}\begin{enumerate}    \item \textbf{Parameters Setup}: The algorithm starts by initializing several parameters:    \begin{itemize}        \item \textit{antnum}: Number of artificial ants.        \item \textit{cyclenum}: Number of successive cycles with no improvement in the best solution before termination.        \item \textit{inittrail}: Initial amount of pheromone on the paths.        \item \textit{$\alpha$ (alpha)}: Parameter to control the influence of pheromone trails.        \item \textit{$\beta$ (beta)}: Parameter to control the influence of heuristic information.        \item \textit{$\rho$ (rho)}: Evaporation rate of the pheromone.    \end{itemize}    \item \textbf{Pheromone Initialization}: All pheromone values $\tau_{ij}$ on the paths are set to \textit{inittrail}.\end{enumerate}\subsection*{Main Cycle}The algorithm operates in cycles, where each cycle consists of the following steps:\begin{enumerate}    \item \textbf{Solution Construction}:    \begin{itemize}        \item Each of the \textit{antnum} ants constructs a solution.        \item Each ant starts from a randomly selected depot and constructs a tour by choosing the next city based on a transition probability until returning to the starting depot.        \item \textbf{Transition Probability}: The probability $p_{ij}^k$ that ant $k$ moves from city $i$ to city $j$ is given by:        \[        p_{ij}^k = \begin{cases}        \frac{[\tau_{ij}(t)]^\alpha [\eta_{ij}]^\beta}{\sum_{k \in \text{allowed}_k} [\tau_{ik}(t)]^\alpha [\eta_{ik}]^\beta} & \text{if } j \in \text{allowed}_k \\        0 & \text{otherwise}        \end{cases}        \]        Here, \textit{allowed\_k} is the set of cities that ant $k$ has not yet visited, $\tau_{ij}(t)$ is the pheromone value on the path from $i$ to $j$ at time $t$, and $\eta_{ij}$ is the heuristic information, typically the inverse of the distance between cities $i$ and $j$.                \item \textbf{Special Cases for Transition Probability}: Modifications are made to avoid infeasible solutions:        \begin{itemize}            \item Ant returns to the depot if it has visited the maximum allowed cities $L$.            \item Ant returns to the depot if continuing would prevent subsequent tours from satisfying the minimum number of cities $K$.        \end{itemize}    \end{itemize}    \item \textbf{Trail Update}:    \begin{itemize}        \item After all ants have constructed their solutions, the pheromone trails are updated.        \item \textbf{Evaporation}: Pheromone on all paths is reduced by a factor of $\rho$:        \[        \tau_{ij} \leftarrow (1 - \rho) \tau_{ij}        \]        \item \textbf{Pheromone Addition}: Pheromone is added to the paths that were used by the ants. If $F_k$ is the objective function value (e.g., inverse of the tour length) for ant $k$, then:        \[        \tau_{ij} \leftarrow \tau_{ij} + \sum_{k=1}^{antnum} \Delta \tau_{ij}^k        \]        where:        \[        \Delta \tau_{ij}^k = \begin{cases}        F_k & \text{if ant } k \text{ uses path } (i,j) \\        0 & \text{otherwise}        \end{cases}        \]    \end{itemize}    \item \textbf{Stopping Criterion}: The cycle repeats until there is no improvement in the best solution for \textit{cyclenum} successive cycles.\end{enumerate}\subsection*{Algorithm Termination}Once the stopping criterion is met, the algorithm returns the best solution found during the cycles.
