Christofides algorithmInput: Complete graph G with weights w satisfying the triangle inequalityOutput: Approximate solution to the Traveling Salesman Problem1. Compute a minimum spanning tree (MST) T of G.2. Identify the set O of vertices with odd degree in T.3. Find a minimum-weight perfect matching M in the subgraph induced by O.4. Combine the edges of T and M to form a multigraph H where each vertex has even degree.5. Find an Eulerian circuit in H.6. Convert the Eulerian circuit into a Hamiltonian circuit by skipping repeated vertices.Return the Hamiltonian circuit.
