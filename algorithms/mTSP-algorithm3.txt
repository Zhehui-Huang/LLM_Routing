This increases the number of exchange opportunities and can lead to significant improvements in the solution.\subsubsection*{Key Steps and Details}\begin{enumerate}    \item \textbf{Initial Solution Generation}:    \begin{itemize}        \item Start by generating an initial solution for the MTSP.    \end{itemize}        \item \textbf{Generalized k-Change}:    \begin{itemize}        \item Apply a generalized k-change to the tour. A k-change involves deleting k edges and replacing them with k other edges.        \item Unlike the classical k-change, the generalized k-change considers exchanges that result in multiple subtours, as long as each subtour includes at least one copy of the depot.    \end{itemize}    \item \textbf{Regenerating a Single Tour}:    \begin{itemize}        \item If the k-change leads to multiple subtours, an equivalent single tour is regenerated by judiciously exchanging "equivalent edges" (edges connecting a node to each copy of the depot). Figure \ref{fig:single_tour} shows how an equivalent single tour can be produced with this simple technique.    \end{itemize}    \begin{figure}[h]        \centering        \includegraphics[width=0.5\textwidth]{single_tour}        \caption{Regenerating a single tour}        \label{fig:single_tour}    \end{figure}    \item \textbf{Iterative Improvement}:    \begin{itemize}        \item Repeat the process of applying generalized k-changes and regenerating a single tour until no further improvement is possible.    \end{itemize}    \item \textbf{Feasibility Check}:    \begin{itemize}        \item Ensure that the resulting tours are feasible. For MTSP, a tour with multiple subtours is feasible if each subtour includes at least one depot copy.    \end{itemize}        \item \textbf{Complexity}:    \begin{itemize}        \item The complexity of the generalized k-opt procedure is higher than the classical k-opt procedure. Specifically, the complexity of the generalized k-opt step is         \[        \binom{n}{k} \times \left( (2k - 1) \times (2k - 3) \times \ldots \times 3 \times 1 - 1 \right),        \]        which simplifies to an order of \( n^k \) for both classical and generalized approaches, but with a higher constant factor for the generalized approach.    \end{itemize}\end{enumerate}\subsubsection*{Results}\textbf{Constraint-Free MTSP}:\begin{itemize}    \item The generalized k-opt procedure consistently found better solutions than the classical k-opt procedure in randomly generated networks.\end{itemize}\subsection*{Conclusion}The generalized k-opt exchange procedure enhances the classical k-opt method by considering exchanges that result in multiple subtours, making it a powerful tool for solving constraint-free MTSPs. This method provides a better balance between solution quality and computational efficiency.\end{document}
