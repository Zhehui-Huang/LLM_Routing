Generalized k-Opt Exchange Procedure for the mTSP

Authors: Jean-Yves Potvin, Guy Lapalme, Jean-Marc Rousseau

Abstract:
This paper introduces a technique that generalizes the classical k-opt exchange by allowing exchanges that lead to the partition of a single tour into multiple subtours, which are then merged back into an equivalent single tour. This method enhances the k-opt procedure by expanding the set of exchange opportunities, which is particularly effective for mTSP problems with time windows.

Key Features of the Generalized k-Opt Procedure:
1. Generalized k-Changes:
   - Considers "generalized" k-changes, which involve splitting a tour into multiple subtours. These subtours are feasible if each contains at least one copy of the depot, offering more exchange opportunities.

2. Feasibility of New Solutions:
   - New solutions are feasible if at least one copy of the depot is included in each subchain, allowing more complex changes than traditional methods.

3. Advantages Over Classical Methods:
   - This generalized approach is shown to be more powerful than the classical k-opt due to its ability to consider a broader range of potential solutions.

4. Performance with Time Windows:
   - Particularly advantageous for mTSP with time windows, as it accommodates constraints more effectively than traditional methods.

5. Numerical Results:
   - Presents numerical results demonstrating the effectiveness of this method on both classical mTSP and mTSP with time windows, showing significant improvements over existing solutions.

Conclusion:
The generalized k-opt exchange procedure provides a robust framework for solving mTSP problems, offering substantial improvements, especially in cases with additional constraints like time windows.
