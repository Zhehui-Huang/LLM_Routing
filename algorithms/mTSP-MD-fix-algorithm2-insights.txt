Abstract:
The paper presents an Ant Colony System (ACS) to solve the complex problem where multiple salesmen operate from several depots and must return to their original starting points after completing their tours. Each city is visited by exactly one salesman, with the aim to minimize the total length of the tours.

Key Insights:

1. Problem Complexity:
   - The fixed destination multi-depot mTSP is noted for its high complexity due to multiple depots and the requirement for each salesman to return to their starting city.

2. Ant Colony System (ACS) Implementation:
   - The ACS is tailored to manage the additional complexity by modifying the transition probabilities and pheromone updates, which guide the ants in constructing solutions that consider multiple depots and fixed endpoints.

3. Algorithm Enhancements:
   - Includes a pheromone evaporation mechanism and dynamic updates based on the quality of the solutions found, which helps avoid local optima and improves the convergence toward optimal solutions.

4. Experimental Results:
   - Comparative results with Lingo 8.0, which uses exact methods, show that the ACS provides competitive solutions with significantly reduced computational times, especially as the problem size increases.

5. Real-world Application Potential:
   - Given its effectiveness and efficiency, this ACS approach is suitable for large-scale logistics and distribution problems where multiple depots are involved, and each operation cycle needs to reset at the origin.

These insights offer a comprehensive understanding of the application of an ant colony system to solve a particularly challenging variant of the mTSP, highlighting both its practical implications and potential for further research and optimization.
