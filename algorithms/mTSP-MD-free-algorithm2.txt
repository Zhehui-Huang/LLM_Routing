\subsection{Chromosome Representation}\textbf{Structure}: Each chromosome is a permutation of the integers representing the cities, partitioned into subtours by inserting negative integers.\begin{itemize}    \item Length: \(n + 2m\) where \(n\) is the number of cities, \(m\) is the number of salesmen.    \item Negative integers: Represent depot transitions, ensuring each salesman starts and ends at a depot.\end{itemize}\textbf{Example}: For \(n = 14\), \(m = 3\), \(d = 2\), and \(m_1 = 2\), \(m_2 = 1\), a chromosome could be: \([-1, 7, 8, -1, 5, 1, -2, 12, 4, -1, -2, 6, 3, 10, 2, 14, 13, 9, 11, -1]\).\subsection{Initial Population}\textbf{Generation}: Chromosomes are generated randomly, ensuring feasibility.\begin{itemize}    \item Permutation: Cities are randomly permuted.    \item Depot Insertions: Negative integers are inserted at appropriate positions, ensuring each tour has at least one city.\end{itemize}\subsection{Crossover}\textbf{Modified 2-point Crossover}:\begin{itemize}    \item Select two points \(r_1\) and \(r_2\) in two parent chromosomes.    \item Offspring Generation:    \begin{itemize}        \item \textbf{O1}: Copy segments before \(r_1\) and after \(r_2\) from Parent 1, fill the middle from Parent 2, avoiding repeats.        \item \textbf{O2}: Copy the middle segment from Parent 1, fill before \(r_1\) and after \(r_2\) from Parent 2, avoiding repeats.        \item \textbf{O3}: Copy segments before \(r_1\) and after \(r_2\) from Parent 2, fill the middle from Parent 1, avoiding repeats.        \item \textbf{O4}: Copy the middle segment from Parent 2, fill before \(r_1\) and after \(r_2\) from Parent 1, avoiding repeats.    \end{itemize}\end{itemize}\textbf{Example}: For parents P1 and P2 with \(n = 12\), \(m = 3\), \(d = 2\), \(m_1 = 2\), \(m_2 = 1\), selecting \(r_1 = 6\) and \(r_2 = 13\):\begin{itemize}    \item \textbf{O1}: \([-1, 7, 8, -1, -2, 5, 6, -1, -1, 12, 3, 4, 1, 10, 2, 9, 11, -2]\)\end{itemize}\subsection{Mutation}\textbf{Operators}:\begin{itemize}    \item \textbf{1-bit}: Move one city to another tour.    \item \textbf{2-opt}: Swap two cities between tours.    \item \textbf{Intra-2-opt}: Swap two cities within the same tour.\end{itemize}\subsection{Parent Selection Strategies}\begin{itemize}    \item \textbf{Elitism}: Select the best chromosomes from the previous generation.    \item \textbf{Roulette Wheel}: Probability-based selection considering fitness.    \item \textbf{Binary Tournament}: Randomly select two chromosomes, choose the better one, repeat.\end{itemize}\subsection{The Genetic Algorithm}\textbf{Parameters}:\begin{itemize}    \item \(G_{\text{max}}\): Maximum generations.    \item \(\sigma_{\text{min}}\): Minimum diversity.    \item \(pop\_size\): Population size.    \item \(cr\): Crossover rate.    \item \(mr\): Mutation rate.    \item \(rr\): Reproduction rate.\end{itemize}\textbf{Steps}:\begin{enumerate}    \item Initialize: \(g = 0\), \(t = 0\), \(c = cr \times pop\_size\), \(m = mr \times pop\_size\), \(r = rr \times pop\_size\).    \item Generate initial population randomly.    \item Repeat until stopping criteria are met:    \begin{itemize}        \item Select \(r\) best chromosomes for next generation.        \item Select parents and perform crossover to produce offspring.        \item Apply mutation to offspring.        \item Replace parents if offspring have better fitness.        \item Continue until the new population is created.    \end{itemize}    \item Stop if \(G_{\text{max}}\) generations have passed or diversity is below \(\sigma_{\text{min}}\).\end{enumerate}
