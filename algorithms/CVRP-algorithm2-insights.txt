Authors: Tantikorn Pichpibul and Ruengsak Kawtummachai

Key Insights:

1. Introduction to CVRP:
   - CVRP optimizes the delivery routes from a depot to various customers, ensuring no vehicle capacity is exceeded.

2. Clarke-Wright Savings Algorithm:
   - Focuses on connecting routes that maximize travel cost savings. The enhancements aim to improve these connections.

3. New Enhancements:
   - Introduce a two-phase probabilistic mechanism and a route post-improvement procedure to enhance solution quality.

4. Two-Phase Probabilistic Mechanism:
   - Introduces randomness in route selection to escape the original algorithm's greedy nature, potentially leading to better solutions.

5. Route Post-Improvement Procedure:
   - Further local optimizations, like customer swaps and reassignments, are performed to refine the solution after initial configurations.

6. Computational Results:
   - Demonstrates significant improvements over the original method in terms of solution quality across various test scenarios.

7. Conclusion:
   - The enhancements make the Clarke-Wright Savings Algorithm a competitive option for solving complex CVRP instances efficiently.

This detailed understanding can help in implementing new routing algorithms or improving existing logistics and delivery systems.
