Guaranteed Performance Heuristics for the Bottleneck Traveling Salesman Problem (BTSP)

Authors: R. Gary Parker and Ronald L. Rardin

Key Insights:

1. Problem Definition:
   - The Bottleneck Traveling Salesman Problem (BTSP) seeks to minimize the maximum edge cost in a Hamiltonian cycle of a graph.

2. Algorithmic Feasibility:
   - No polynomial-time, constant-performance-bound algorithm can exist for BTSP with arbitrary costs unless P=NP.

3. Heuristic Development:
   - For graphs with positive costs adhering to the triangle inequality, a polynomial-time heuristic with a worst-case performance bound of 2 is developed.

4. Algorithmic Approach:
   - The algorithm, named Algorithm BT, operates by:
     1. Generating a bottleneck-optimal biconnected subgraph.
     2. Tracing a Hamiltonian cycle in the square of this subgraph to approximate the optimal tour for BTSP.

5. Performance Bounds:
   - Under the triangle inequality condition, the heuristic guarantees that the maximum edge cost of the solution is at most twice the optimal value.

6. Theoretical Contributions:
   - Leverages properties of biconnected graphs and the concept of graph squaring, providing a methodologically interesting solution.

7. Implications for Further Research:
   - Suggests potential for further improvements in heuristic design or problem constraints could potentially lower the bound of 2.

These insights offer a structured approach to tackling the BTSP, useful under specific graph conditions, contributing to heuristic algorithm design for combinatorial optimization problems.
