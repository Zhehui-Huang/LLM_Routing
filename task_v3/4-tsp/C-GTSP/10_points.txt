Environment Information:

There are ten cities, each with a specified location:

City 1: (9, 4)
City 2: (4, 6)
City 3: (4, 4) [Depot]
City 4: (3, 4)
City 5: (4, 8)
City 6: (4, 3)
City 7: (7, 5)
City 8: (5, 0)
City 9: (1, 5)
City 10: (9, 3)

There are six city groups.

City group A: City 7, City 8
City group B: City 1
City group C: City 2, City 4
City group D: City 5, City 9
City group E: City 10
City group F: City 6
"""

"""
Robot information:

Four robots are available for tasks.
All robots start their journeys from the depot (City 3), and the travel cost between any two cities is determined by the Euclidean distance.
All robots can travel between any two cities, except travel between the same city.
"""

###
Objective:
The goal is to minimize the maximum tour cost among all robots under the given constraints.
Each city group must be visited exactly once by one of the robots, and no city group should be visited by more than one robot.

Constraints:
1. Each robot starts its tour from the depot (City 3) and must return to the depot (City 3) after completing its tour.
2. Each city group must be visited exactly once by one of the robots, ensuring no city group is visited by more than one robot.
3. The objective is to minimize the maximum cost of the tours among all robots.
