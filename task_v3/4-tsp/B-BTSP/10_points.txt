Robot information:

There are four robots.
- The depot of all robots is city 3.
- All robots can travel between any two cities, except travel between the same city.
- The travel cost is the Euclidean distance between two cities.

###
Task:
All robots starting their tours from the depot, with the goal of visiting all cities exactly once by any robot, and all robots must return to the depot after completing their tours of the cities.
Each city must be visited exactly once by any one of the robots.
All robots start their tour from the depot. After completing their tours, each robot must return to the depot.

Please provide a solution to:
Primary objective: minimize the maximum travel cost between any two consecutive cities in any robot's tour.
Secondary objective: minimize the discrepancy or balance the tour costs among all robots.
