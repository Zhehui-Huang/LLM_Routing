Environment information:

There are ten cities.

The distance between each pair of cities are presented in a distance matrix below:

[ 0,  4,  8,  5,  7,  2,  3,  9,  8,  5]
[ 4,  0,  8,  3,  6,  5,  2,  8,  6,  2]
[ 5,  1,  0,  6,  9,  1, 10,  3,  7,  4]
[ 9,  3,  5,  0,  7,  4,  9,  7,  2,  4]
[ 9,  2, 10,  9,  0,  5,  2,  4,  7,  8]
[ 3,  1,  4,  2,  8,  0,  2,  5,  6, 10]
[ 4,  6,  2,  4,  2, 10,  0,  8,  7,  9]
[ 8,  5,  2,  5,  8, 10,  9,  0,  1,  9]
[ 7,  9,  8,  1,  8,  8,  3,  1,  0,  3]
[ 3,  1,  5, 10,  7, 10,  9,  7,  9,  0]

The index of the raw and column is 1-based.

For each value in the matrix, the row index represents the starting city, and the column index represents the destination city.
For example, the distance between city 1 and city 2 is 4.

Robot information:

Four robots are available for the task.
All robots start their journeys from the depot (City 3), and the travel cost between any two cities is determined by the distance matrix.
All robots can travel between any two cities, except travel between the same city.
"""

###
Objective:
The goal is to minimize the maximum tour cost among all robots under the given constraints.
Each city can be visited by multiple robot multiple times.
Each city must be visited by at least one robot one time.

Constraints:
1. Each robot starts its tour from the depot (City 3) and must return to the depot (City 3) after completing its tour.
2. Each city can be visited by multiple robot multiple times.
3. Each city must be visited by at least one robot one time.
4. The goal is to minimize the maximum cost of the tours among all robots.
5. There are only four robots available for the task.
6. The travel cost between any two cities is determined by the distance matrix.
7. All robots can travel between any two cities, except travel between the same city.
