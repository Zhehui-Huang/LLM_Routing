Task:
All robots starting their tours from the depot, with the goal of visiting a subset of cities, and all robots must return to the depot after completing their tours of the cities.
Each city can only be visited at most once by any one of the robots.
All robots start their tour from the depot. After completing their tours, each robot must return to the depot.

All robots work together to buy 60 units of product in total.
If a city be visited by a robot, the robot must purchase all units of the product from the city.

The goal is to minimize the tour costs (travel cost + purchasing cost) among all robots, while satisfying the purchase of enough products.
