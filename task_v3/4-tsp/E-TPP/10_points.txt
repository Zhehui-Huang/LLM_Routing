- The travel cost is the Euclidean distance between two cities.

###
Task:

All robots need to visit cities cooperatively to buy products and then return to city 1.
Each city, except the starting cities, can only be visited once by any robot.

All robots need to work together to buy 60 units of product in total.

Please provide a solution to minimize the tour costs (travel cost + purchasing cost) among all robots, while satisfying the purchase of enough products.
