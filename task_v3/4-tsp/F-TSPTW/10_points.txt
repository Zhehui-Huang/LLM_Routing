Environment information:

There are ten cities.

City 1 has location (9, 4)
City 2 has location (4, 6)
City 3 has location (4, 4)
City 4 has location (3, 4)
City 5 has location (4, 8)
City 6 has location (4, 3)
City 7 has location (7, 5)
City 8 has location (5, 0)
City 9 has location (1, 5)
City 10 has location (9, 3)

Each city has a service time window [start time, end time].
After a city's last possible service time, it cannot be visited.
"""

"""
Robot information:

There is four robots.
- All robots are at city 1, which is the depot.
- All robots travel 1 unit of distance with 1 unit of time.
- All robots can travel between any two cities.
- The travel cost of all robots is the Euclidean distance between two cities.
"""

###
Task:

All robots need to work together to visit all cities exactly once, except the starting cities, and then back to the starting city.
Each city must be visited within the time window below:

City 1: This city is the depot. This city can be visited at any time.
City 2: Time window [4, 6]
City 3: Time window [2, 8]
City 4: Time window [2, 8]
City 5: Time window [6, 15]
City 6: Time window [5, 10]
City 7: Time window [1, 5]
City 8: Time window [2, 7]
City 9: Time window [5, 10]
City 10: Time window [4, 8]

Please provide a solution to minimize the sum of all robots' travel costs while satisfying the time window constraints.
