Environment Information:

There are ten cities, each with a specified location:

City 1: (9, 4)
City 2: (4, 6)
City 3: (4, 4) [Depot]
City 4: (3, 4)
City 5: (4, 8)
City 6: (4, 3)
City 7: (7, 5)
City 8: (5, 0)
City 9: (1, 5)
City 10: (9, 3)
"""

"""
Robot information:

Four robots are available for tasks.
All robots start their journeys from the depot (City 3), and the travel cost between any two cities is determined by the Euclidean distance.
All robots can travel between any two cities, except travel between the same city.
All robots travel 1 unit of distance with 1 unit of time.
"""

###
Objective:
The goal is to minimize the maximum tour cost among all robots under the given constraints.
Each city must be visited exactly once by one of the robots, and no city should be visited by more than one robot.
Each city has a service time window. Robots must visit the cities within the given time window.

Constraints:
1. Each robot starts its tour from the depot (City 3) and must return to the depot (City 3) after completing its tour.
2. Each city must be visited exactly once by one of the robots. No city should be visited by more than one robot.
3. Each city has a service time window [start time, end time]. After a city's last possible service time, it cannot be visited.
    City 1: Time window [3, 8]
    City 2: Time window [5, 12]
    City 3: This city is the depot.
    City 4: Time window [0, 4]
    City 5: Time window [1, 10]
    City 6: Time window [1, 5]
    City 7: Time window [1, 10]
    City 8: Time window [3, 6]
    City 9: Time window [2, 6]
    City 10: Time window [7, 11]
4. The goal is to minimize the maximum cost of the tours among all robots.
