Environment information:

There are five cities.

City 1: (9, 4) [Depot]
City 2: (4, 6)
City 3: (4, 4) [Depot]
City 4: (3, 4)
City 5: (4, 8)

City 1 and City 3 both are depots.
"""

"""
Robot information:

There is one robot.
- The robot starts at city 3.
- The robot can travel between any two cities.
- The travel cost of the robot is the Euclidean distance between two cities.
- The robot has the energy, which allows it to travel at most 9 units of distance.
- The robot can recharge at any depot, and the energy will be fully recharged after recharging.
"""

###
Objective:
The objective is minimizing the tour costs, while considering energy management and depot visits (crucial to achieving this objective).

Constraints:
1. The robot starts its tour from the depot (City 3) and must return to one of the depots after completing its tour.
2. Each city must be visited exactly once.
3. Depot cities must be visited at least once.
4. The travel cost between any two cities is determined by the Euclidean distance.
5. Energy constraints
    a. Each time the robot visits any depot city (City 1, City 3), its energy is fully recharged to 9 units, allowing it to continue its tour with renewed energy capacity.
    b. Visiting a depot not only allows for energy recharge but also is necessary for the robot to extend its tour beyond the initial energy limit.
    c. The robot must arrive at a depot before they run out of energy. Otherwise, the tour will be failed.
    d. You need to plan the tour considering the energy constraints, ensuring that the robot visit a depot before its energy depletes, to recharge.
       For instance, a robot might start at City 3, then recharge at City 1 before continuing its tour.
