Environment information:
There are ten cities.

The distance between each pair of cities are presented in a distance matrix below:

[ 0,  4,  8,  5,  7,  2,  3,  9,  8,  5]
[ 4,  0,  8,  3,  6,  5,  2,  8,  6,  2]
[ 5,  1,  0,  6,  9,  1, 10,  3,  7,  4]
[ 9,  3,  5,  0,  7,  4,  9,  7,  2,  4]
[ 9,  2, 10,  9,  0,  5,  2,  4,  7,  8]
[ 3,  1,  4,  2,  8,  0,  2,  5,  6, 10]
[ 4,  6,  2,  4,  2, 10,  0,  8,  7,  9]
[ 8,  5,  2,  5,  8, 10,  9,  0,  1,  9]
[ 7,  9,  8,  1,  8,  8,  3,  1,  0,  3]
[ 3,  1,  5, 10,  7, 10,  9,  7,  9,  0]

The index of the raw and column is 1-based.

For each value in the matrix, the row index represents the starting city, and the column index represents the destination city.
For example, the distance between city 1 and city 2 is 4.


Each city may sell different products at different prices.

City 2 sells
    - T-shirts (15 units at $20 each)
    - Hats (30 units at $5 each)

City 3 sells
    - Hats (5 units at $20 each)
    - Jeans (10 units at $10 each)

City 4 sells
    - Jeans (10 units at $15 each)
    - Hats (5 units at $25 each)

City 5 sells
    - T-shirts (20 units at $5 each)
    - Jeans (20 units at $10 each)

City 6 sells
    - Hats (15 units at $15 each)
    - Shoes (25 units at $30 each)

City 7 sells
    - Shoes (10 units at $25 each)
    - Jeans (15 units at $12 each)

City 8 sells
    - T-shirts (10 units at $18 each)
    - Shoes (20 units at $20 each)

City 9 sells
    - T-shirts (15 units at $22 each)
    - Jeans (10 units at $18 each)

City 10 sells
    - Hats (20 units at $22 each)
    - Shoes (15 units at $28 each)


There is a robot.
- The robot is at city 1.
- The robot can travel between any two cities.
- The travel cost is 10 times the Euclidean distance between two cities.
"""

###
Task:
The robot needs to visit cities to buy products and then return to city 1.
Each city, except the starting cities, can only be visited once.

The products the robot needs to buy are:
- 30 T-shirts
- 30 Jeans
- 30 Hats
- 30 Shoes

Please find a route between a subset of the cities that minimizes total cost (travel cost + purchasing cost) and enables the purchase of all required products.
