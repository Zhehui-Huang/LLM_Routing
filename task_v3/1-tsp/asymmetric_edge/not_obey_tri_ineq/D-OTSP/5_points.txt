"""
Environment information:
There are five cities.

The distance between each pair of cities are presented in a distance matrix below:

[0, 2, 3, 7, 2]
[3, 0, 5, 3, 2]
[2, 4, 0, 5, 3]
[2, 1, 2, 0, 1]
[6, 3, 2, 3, 0]

The index of the raw and column is 1-based.

For each value in the matrix, the row index represents the starting city, and the column index represents the destination city.
For example, the distance between city 1 and city 2 is 2.


There is a robot.
- The robot is at city 1.
- The robot can travel between any two cities.
- The travel cost is the Euclidean distance between two cities.
"""

###
Task:
The robot needs to visit all cities exactly once, except the starting cities, and then back to the starting city.
The robot must visit city 4 before city 2 and must visit city 2 before city 3.
Please find the shortest tour for the robot.
