"""
Environment information:
There are ten cities.

The distance between each pair of cities are presented in a distance matrix below:

[ 0,  4,  8,  5,  7,  2,  3,  9,  8,  5]
[ 4,  0,  8,  3,  6,  5,  2,  8,  6,  2]
[ 5,  1,  0,  6,  9,  1, 10,  3,  7,  4]
[ 9,  3,  5,  0,  7,  4,  9,  7,  2,  4]
[ 9,  2, 10,  9,  0,  5,  2,  4,  7,  8]
[ 3,  1,  4,  2,  8,  0,  2,  5,  6, 10]
[ 4,  6,  2,  4,  2, 10,  0,  8,  7,  9]
[ 8,  5,  2,  5,  8, 10,  9,  0,  1,  9]
[ 7,  9,  8,  1,  8,  8,  3,  1,  0,  3]
[ 3,  1,  5, 10,  7, 10,  9,  7,  9,  0]

The index of the raw and column is 1-based.

For each value in the matrix, the row index represents the starting city, and the column index represents the destination city.
For example, the distance between city 1 and city 2 is 4.


Each city has a service time window [start time, end time].
After a city's last possible service time, it cannot be visited.


There is a robot.
- The robot is at city 1.
- The robot travels 1 unit of distance with 1 unit of time.
- The robot can travel between any two cities.
- The travel cost is the Euclidean distance between two cities.

###
Task:
The robot needs to visit all cities exactly once, except the starting cities, and then back to the starting city.

Each city must be visited within the time window below:

City 1: This city is the city where the depot. This city can be visited at any time.
City 2: Time window [4, 8]
City 3: Time window [5, 9]
City 4: Time window [20, 32]
City 5: Time window [20, 50]
City 6: Time window [1, 8]
City 7: Time window [15, 30]
City 8: Time window [8, 16]
City 9: Time window [20, 36]
City 10: Time window [22, 39]

Please find the shortest tour for the robot.
