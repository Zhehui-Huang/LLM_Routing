"""
Environment information:
There are five objects.

Object 1 moves from (0, 0) to (10, 0) in 10 units of time with constant speed.
Object 2 moves from (0, 0) to (0, 10) in 10 units of time with constant speed.
Object 3 moves from (10, 10) to (0, 0) in 10 units of time with constant speed.
Object 4 moves from (1, 0) to (1, 10) in 10 units of time with constant speed.
Object 5 moves from (0, 6) to (10, 6) in 10 units of time with constant speed.

There is a robot.
- The depot of the robot is (2, 2)
- The robot can move between any two objects with 1 unit of time.
- The travel cost is the Euclidean distance between two points.
"""

###
Task:
The robot needs to visit all objects exactly once, and then back to the depot.
Please find the tour with the smallest travel cost for the robot.
