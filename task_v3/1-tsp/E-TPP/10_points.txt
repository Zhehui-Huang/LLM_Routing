Each city, except the starting cities, can only be visited once.

The products the robot needs to buy are:
- 30 T-shirts
- 30 Jeans
- 30 Hats
- 30 Shoes

Please find a route between a subset of the cities that minimizes total cost (travel cost + purchasing cost) and enables the purchase of all required products.
