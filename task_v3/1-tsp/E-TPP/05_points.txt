Environment information:

There are five cities.

City 1: (9, 4)
City 2: (4, 6)
City 3: (4, 4) [Depot]
City 4: (3, 4)
City 5: (4, 8)

Each city sell the product with different amount at different prices.

City 1:
    5 units at $8 each

City 2:
    15 units at $5 each

City 4:
    10 units at $4 each

City 5:
    20 units at $10 each

"""

"""
Robot information:

There is a robot.
- The robot starts at city 3.
- The robot can travel between any two cities.
- The travel cost is 10 times the Euclidean distance between two cities.
"""

###
Objective:
The goal is to minimize the tour costs (travel cost + purchasing cost) while satisfying buy 30 units of product.

Constraints:
1. The robot starts its tour from the depot (City 3) and must return to the depot (City 3) after completing its tour.
2. Each city can be visited at most once.
3. The travel cost between any two cities is determined by the 10 times the Euclidean distance between these two cities.
4. If a city be visited by the robot, the robot must purchase all units of the product from the city.
5. The robot needs to buy 30 units of product.
