Environment information:

There are five cities.

City 1: (9, 4)
City 2: (4, 6)
City 3: (4, 4) [Depot]
City 4: (3, 4)
City 5: (4, 8)
"""

"""
Robot information:

There is a robot.
- The robot starts at city 3.
- The robot can travel between any two cities.
- The travel cost is the Euclidean distance between two cities.
"""

###
Objective:
The goal is to minimize the tour cost.

Constraints:
1. The robot starts its tour from the depot (City 3) and must return to the depot (City 3) after completing its tour.
2. Each city must be visited exactly once.
3. The travel cost between any two cities is determined by the Euclidean distance.
4. There are sequence constraints. Within a tour of the robot, if any subset of the cities 1, 2, 4 are visited, they must be visited in the sequence dictated by their numbering. This means that:
    a. If the robot's tour includes city 1 and city 4, then city 1 must be visited before city 4.
    b. This sequential constraint applies to any combination of these cities included in a single robot's tour, ensuring that the order 1 -> 2 -> 4 is maintained for any cities present from this list.
