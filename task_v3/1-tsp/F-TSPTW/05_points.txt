Environment information:

There are five cities.

City 1: (9, 4)
City 2: (4, 6)
City 3: (4, 4) [Depot]
City 4: (3, 4)
City 5: (4, 8)
"""

"""
Robot information:

There is a robot.
- The robot starts at city 3.
- The robot travels 1 unit of distance with 1 unit of time.
- The robot can travel between any two cities.
- The travel cost is the Euclidean distance between two cities.
"""

###
Objective:
The goal is to minimize the tour cost.

Constraints:
1. The robot starts its tour from the depot (City 3) and must return to the depot (City 3) after completing its tour.
2. Each city must be visited exactly once.
3. The travel cost between any two cities is determined by the Euclidean distance.
4. Each city has a service time window [start time, end time]. After a city's end time of service, it cannot be visited.
City 1: Time window [2, 10]
City 2: Time window [9, 12]
City 3: This city is the city where the depot. This city can be visited at any time.
City 4: Time window [1, 20]
City 5: Time window [10, 15]
