Environment information:

There are five cities.

The distance between each pair of cities are presented in a distance matrix below:

[0, 2, 3, 7, 2]
[3, 0, 5, 3, 2]
[2, 4, 0, 5, 3]
[2, 1, 2, 0, 1]
[6, 3, 2, 3, 0]

The index of the raw and column is 1-based.

For each value in the matrix, the row index represents the starting city, and the column index represents the destination city.
For example, the distance between city 1 and city 2 is 2, the distance between city 1 and city 4 is 7.

"""
Robot information:

There is a robot.
- The robot starts at city 3.
- The robot can travel between any two cities.
- The travel cost is the Euclidean distance between two cities.
"""

###
Objective:
The goal is to minimize the tour cost.

Constraints:
1. The robot starts its tour from the depot (City 3) and must return to the depot (City 3) after completing its tour.
2. Each city can be visited multiple times.
3. The travel cost between any two cities is determined by the distance matrix.
