Robot information:

There is a robot.
- The depot of the robot is (2, 2)
- The robot can move between any two objects with 1 unit of time.
- The travel cost is the Euclidean distance between two points.
"""

###
Task:
The robot needs to visit all objects exactly once, and then back to the depot.
Please find the tour with the smallest travel cost for the robot.
