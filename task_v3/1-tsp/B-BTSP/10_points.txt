Environment information:

There are ten cities.

City 1: (9, 4)
City 2: (4, 6)
City 3: (4, 4) [Depot]
City 4: (3, 4)
City 5: (4, 8)
City 6: (4, 3)
City 7: (7, 5)
City 8: (5, 0)
City 9: (1, 5)
City 10: (9, 3)

"""
Robot information:

There is a robot.
- The robot starts at city 3.
- The robot can travel between any two cities.
- The travel cost is the Euclidean distance between two cities.
"""

###
Objective:
Primary objective: minimize the travel cost between any two consecutive cities in the robot's tour.
Secondary objective: minimize the discrepancy or balance the tour costs.
It's crucial that the solution first and foremost addresses the primary objective, with the secondary objective considered only after the primary has been optimized.

Constraints:
1. The robot starts its tour from the depot (City 3) and must return to the depot (City 3) after completing its tour.
2. Each city must be visited exactly once.
3. The travel cost between any two cities is determined by the Euclidean distance.
