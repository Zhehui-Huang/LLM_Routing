Environment Information:

There are ten cities, each with a specified location:

City 1: (9, 4)
City 2: (4, 6)
City 3: (4, 4) [Depot]
City 4: (3, 4)
City 5: (4, 8)
City 6: (4, 3)
City 7: (7, 5)
City 8: (5, 0)
City 9: (1, 5)
City 10: (9, 3)
"""

"""
Robot information:

Four robots are available for the task.
All robots start their journeys from the depot (City 3), and the travel cost between any two cities is determined by the Euclidean distance.
All robots can travel between any two cities, except travel between the same city.
"""

###
Task:
All robots needs to work together to visit all cities within a 5-unit distance from the depot exactly once, except the starting cities, and then back to the starting city.
Each selected city must be visited exactly once by one of the robots.
Please find the shortest tour for the robot.

The goal is to minimize the maximum cost of the tours among all robots.
