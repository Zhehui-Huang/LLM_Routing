Environment Information:

There are ten cities, each with a specified location:

City 1: (9, 4)
City 2: (4, 6)
City 3: (4, 4) [Depot]
City 4: (3, 4)
City 5: (4, 8)
City 6: (4, 3)
City 7: (7, 5)
City 8: (5, 0)
City 9: (1, 5)
City 10: (9, 3)
"""

"""
Robot information:

Four robots are available for the task.
All robots start their journeys from the depot (City 3), and the travel cost between any two cities is determined by the Euclidean distance.
All robots can travel between any two cities, except travel between the same city.
"""

###
Task:
All robots starting their tours from the depot, with the goal of visiting all cities exactly once by any robot, and all robots must return to the depot after completing their tours of the cities.
Each city must be visited exactly once by any one of the robots.
There is a sequential constraint for all robots. For the tour of each robot, it must ensure the order 2 → 4 → 5 → 6 → 7.
The goal is to minimize the maximum tour cost among all robots.
