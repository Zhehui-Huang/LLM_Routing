Environment Information:

There are ten cities, each with a specified location:

City 1: (9, 4)
City 2: (4, 6)
City 3: (4, 4) [Depot]
City 4: (3, 4)
City 5: (4, 8)
City 6: (4, 3)
City 7: (7, 5)
City 8: (5, 0)
City 9: (1, 5)
City 10: (9, 3)
"""

"""
Robot information:

Four robots are available for the task.
All robots start their journeys from the depot (City 3), and the travel cost between any two cities is determined by the Euclidean distance.
All robots can travel between any two cities, except travel between the same city.
"""

###
Objective:
Primary objective: minimize the maximum travel cost between any two consecutive cities in any robot's tour.
Secondary objective: minimize the discrepancy or balance the tour costs among all robots.
It's crucial that the solution first and foremost addresses the primary objective, with the secondary objective considered only after the primary has been optimized.
Each city must be visited exactly once by one of the robots, and no city should be visited by more than one robot.

Constraints:
1. Each robot starts its tour from the depot (City 3) and must return to the depot (City 3) after completing its tour.
2. Each city must be visited exactly once by one of the robots. No city should be visited by more than one robot.
3. The primary objective is minimizing the maximum travel cost between any two consecutive cities in any robot's tour.
4. The secondary objective is minimizing the discrepancy or balance the tour costs among all robots.
5. It's crucial that the solution first and foremost addresses the primary objective, with the secondary objective considered only after the primary has been optimized.
6. You must use exactly four robots for the task.
7. The travel cost between any two cities is determined by the Euclidean distance.
8. All robots can travel between any two cities, except travel between the same city.
