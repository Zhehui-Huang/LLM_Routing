Environment Information:

There are ten cities, each with a specified location:

City 1: (9, 4)
City 2: (4, 6)
City 3: (4, 4) [Depot]
City 4: (3, 4)
City 5: (4, 8)
City 6: (4, 3)
City 7: (7, 5)
City 8: (5, 0)
City 9: (1, 5)
City 10: (9, 3)

Each city may sell different products at different prices.

City 1:
    5 units at $20 each

City 2:
    15 units at $11 each

City 4:
    10 units at $15 each

City 5:
    20 units at $9 each

City 6:
    15 units at $10 each

City 7:
    10 units at $16 each

City 8:
    10 units at $8 each

City 9:
    15 units at $2 each

City 10:
    20 units at $6 each

Robot information:

Four robots are available for the task.
All robots start their journeys from the depot (City 3), and the travel cost between any two cities is determined by the 10 times the Euclidean distance between these two cities.
All robots can travel between any two cities, except travel between the same city.
Each robot has its own capacity. Robot A can carry up to 10 units, Robot B can carry up to 15 units, Robot C can carry up to 20 units, and Robot D can carry up to 20 units.

###
Objective:
The goal is to minimize the maximum tour costs (travel cost + purchasing cost) among all robots under the given constraints.
Each city can be visited at most once by one of the robots. No city should be visited by more than one robot.
If a city be visited by a robot, the robot must purchase all units of the product from the city.
The product amount that a robot carries should not exceed its capacity.
All robots collaborate to buy 60 units of product in total.

Constraints:
1. Each robot starts its tour from the depot (City 3) and must return to the depot (City 3) after completing its tour.
2. Each city can be visited at most once by one of the robots. No city should be visited by more than one robot.
3. All robots collaborate to buy 60 units of product in total.
4. Each robot has its own capacity. Robot A can carry up to 10 units, Robot B can carry up to 15 units, Robot C can carry up to 20 units, and Robot D can carry up to 20 units.
5. The product amount that a robot carries should not exceed its capacity.
6. If a city be visited by a robot, the robot must purchase all units of the product from the city.
7. The goal is to minimize the maximum tour costs (travel cost + purchasing cost) among all robots.
8. You must use exactly four robots for the task.
9. The travel cost between any two cities is determined by the 10 times the Euclidean distance between these two cities.
10. All robots can travel between any two cities, except travel between the same city.
