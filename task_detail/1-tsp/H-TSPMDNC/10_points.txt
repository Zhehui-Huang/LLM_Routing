Environment information:

There are ten cities.

City 1: (9, 4) [Depot]
City 2: (4, 6)
City 3: (4, 4) [Depot]
City 4: (3, 4)
City 5: (4, 8)
City 6: (4, 3)
City 7: (7, 5) [Depot]
City 8: (5, 0)
City 9: (1, 5)
City 10: (9, 3)

City 1, City 3, City 7 are all depots.
"""

"""
Robot information:

There is one robot.
- The robot starts at city 3.
- The robot can travel between any two cities.
- The travel cost of the robot is the Euclidean distance between two cities.
"""

###
Objective:
The goal is to minimize the tour cost.

Constraints:
1. The robot starts its tour from the depot (City 3) and must return to one of the depots after completing its tour.
2. Each city must be visited exactly once.
3. Depot cities must be visited at least once.
4. The travel cost between any two cities is determined by the Euclidean distance.
