Environment information:

There are ten cities.

City 1: (9, 4)
City 2: (4, 6)
City 3: (4, 4) [Depot]
City 4: (3, 4)
City 5: (4, 8)
City 6: (4, 3)
City 7: (7, 5)
City 8: (5, 0)
City 9: (1, 5)
City 10: (9, 3)

"""
Robot information:

There is a robot.
- The robot is at city 3.
- The robot can travel between any two cities.
- The travel cost is the Euclidean distance between two cities.
"""

###
Objective:
The goal is to minimize the tour cost. The robot will only visit the cities with the distance to the city 3 less than or equal to 4 units.

Constraints:
1. The robot starts its tour from the depot (City 3) and must return to the depot (City 3) after completing its tour.
2. The travel cost between any two cities is determined by the Euclidean distance.
3. Only cities within a 4-unit distance from the depot (City 3) are selected for visits.
4. Each selected city must be visited exactly once.
