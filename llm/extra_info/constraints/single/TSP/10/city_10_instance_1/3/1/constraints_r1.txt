- [Requirement 1] The robot must start and end the tour at the depot city (index 0).
- [Requirement 2] The robot must visit each of the other cities (indices 1 to 9) exactly once.
- [Requirement 3] Travel cost between two cities is calculated as the Euclidean distance.
- [Requirement 4] The output should include both the order of cities visited in the tour (starting and ending at the depot city) and the total travel cost of this tour.
- [Requirement 5] The solution must minimize the total travel cost.
- [Requirement 6] The robot can travel directly between any two cities.
