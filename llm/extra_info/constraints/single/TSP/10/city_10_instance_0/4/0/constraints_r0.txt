- [The problem involves 10 cities, including a depot city 0.]
- [The robot starts its tour at the depot city 0 and must return to the depot after visiting all other cities.]
- [Each city must be visited exactly once by the robot, apart from the depot city which must be visited exactly twice (start and end of the tour).]
- [Travel cost between two cities is determined by the Euclidean distance.]
- [The output should include the shortest tour as a list of city indices starting and ending at the depot city.]
- [The output should also include the total travel cost of the tour.]
