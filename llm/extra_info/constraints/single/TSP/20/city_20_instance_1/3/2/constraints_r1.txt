- [There are 20 cities indexed from 0 to 19, with specific coordinates, where city 0 is the depot.]
- [One robot starts the journey at the depot city (city 0).]
- [The robot must visit each city exactly once and return to the depot city, creating a closed tour.]
- [Travel cost between cities is determined by the Euclidean distance.]
- [Output the tour as a list of city indices starting and ending at the depot city.]
- [Output the total travel cost of the resulting tour.]
