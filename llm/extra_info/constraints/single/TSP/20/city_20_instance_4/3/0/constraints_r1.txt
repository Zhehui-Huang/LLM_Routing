- [The robot must visit each city exactly once, except for the depot city, during its tour.]
- [Travel cost between cities is calculated using the Euclidean distance.]
- [The objective is to find the shortest possible tour for the robot.]
- [Output should list the tour as indices of cities starting and ending at City 0, followed by the total travel cost of the tour.]
