- [There are 15 cities including the depot.]
- [Depot city is city 0 with coordinates (35, 40).]
- [Other city coordinates are provided for each city from 1 to 14.]
- [There is one robot that starts at the depot city 0.]
- [The robot must visit all cities exactly once, excluding the depot, and then return to the depot city.]
- [Travel cost between any two cities is calculated using the Euclidean distance.]
- [The output should include the shortest tour starting and ending at the depot and the total travel cost of this tour.]
- [The output format should be a tour list of city indices and the total travel cost.]
