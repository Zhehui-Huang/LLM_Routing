- [The robot must visit each city exactly once, excluding the depot city (city 0), and return to the depot city to complete the tour.]
- [The travel cost between any two cities is calculated using the Euclidean distance.]
- [The robot starts and ends its tour at the depot city (city 0).]
- [The task is to find the shortest possible route that satisfies the above constraints.]
- [The output format should include a list of city indices representing the tour starting and ending at the depot city, followed by the total travel cost of the tour.]
