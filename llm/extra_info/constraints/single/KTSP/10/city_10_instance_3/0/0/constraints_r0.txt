- [There are 10 cities with specific coordinates provided.]
- [There is one robot starting at the depot city, which is city 0.]
- [The robot must start and end its tour at the depot city 0.]
- [The robot needs to visit exactly 7 cities, including the depot city.]
- [The robot can travel between any two cities.]
- [The travel cost is calculated as the Euclidean distance between two cities.]
- [The goal is to find the shortest possible tour that visits exactly 7 cities.]
- [The output should list the tour as city indices, starting and ending at city 0.]
- [The output should also include the total travel cost of the tour.]
