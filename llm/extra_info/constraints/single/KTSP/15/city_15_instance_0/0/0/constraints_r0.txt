- [There are 15 cities indexed from 0 to 14 with given coordinates.]
- [The robot starts and ends its tour at the depot city, which is city 0.]
- [The robot can travel between any two cities.]
- [Travel cost between cities is calculated using the Euclidean distance between their coordinates.]
- [The robot must visit exactly 4 cities in total, including the depot city, in its tour.]
- [The goal is to find the shortest possible tour that covers exactly 4 cities.]
- [The output should include the tour as a list of city indices starting and ending at city 0, and the total travel cost.]
