- [Requirement 4] The objective is to minimize the longest distance between any two consecutive cities in the tour.
- [Requirement 5] Output needs to include the tour route beginning and ending at city 0, the total travel cost of the tour, and the maximum distance between any two consecutive cities in the tour.
