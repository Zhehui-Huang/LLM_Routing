- [There are 10 cities, including the depot at index 0.]
- [The robot starts and ends its tour at the depot city 0.]
- [The robot must visit each city exactly once.]
- [Travel cost is calculated using Euclidean distance between cities.]
- [The goal is to minimize the longest distance between any two consecutive cities in the tour.]
- [Output should include the tour as a list of city indices, total travel cost of the tour, and the maximum distance between any two consecutive cities.]
