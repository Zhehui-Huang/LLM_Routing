- [The robot must visit each city exactly once, starting and ending at the depot city 0.]
- [The travel cost between cities is calculated using the Euclidean distance.]
- [The aim is to minimize the longest distance between any two consecutive cities in the tour.]
- [Output should include the tour as a list of city indices starting and ending at city 0.]
- [Output should include the total travel cost of the tour.]
- [Output should include the maximum distance between any two consecutive cities in the tour.]
