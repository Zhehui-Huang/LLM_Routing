- [Requirement 4] The total travel cost is the sum of the Euclidean distances between consecutively visited cities.
- [Requirement 5] The travel cost between two cities is calculated using the Euclidean distance formula.
- [Requirement 6] The goal is to minimize the longest distance between any two consecutive cities in the tour.
- [Requirement 7] Output the tour as a list of city indices, starting and ending at city 0.
- [Requirement 8] Output the total travel cost of the tour.
- [Requirement 9] Output the maximum distance between any two consecutive cities in the tour.
