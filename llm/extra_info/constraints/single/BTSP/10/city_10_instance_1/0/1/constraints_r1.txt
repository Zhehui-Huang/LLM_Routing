- [The robot must visit each city exactly once, starting and ending at the depot city 0.]
- [The goal is to minimize the longest distance between any two consecutive cities in the tour.]
- [Travel cost is calculated as the Euclidean distance between two cities.]
- [Output should include the tour starting and ending at the depot city 0 as a list of city indices.]
- [Output should include the total travel cost of the tour.]
- [Output should include the maximum distance between any two consecutive cities in the tour.]
