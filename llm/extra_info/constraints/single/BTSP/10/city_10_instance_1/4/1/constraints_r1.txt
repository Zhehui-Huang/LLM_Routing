- [Requirement 1] The robot must start and end the tour at the depot city (city 0).
- [Requirement 2] The robot must visit each city exactly once, except for the depot city which is visited twice (start and end of the tour).
- [Requirement 3] The objective is to minimize the longest distance between any two consecutive cities in the tour.
- [Requirement 4] The output should include the tour as a list of city indices, the total travel cost of the tour, and the maximum distance between any two consecutive cities.
- [Requirement 5] The travel cost between two cities is calculated as the Euclidean distance between them.
