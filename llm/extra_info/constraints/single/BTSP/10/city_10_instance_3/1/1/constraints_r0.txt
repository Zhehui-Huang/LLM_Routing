- [The robot must start and end its journey at depot city 0.]
- [The robot must visit each city exactly once, excluding the start/end at depot city 0.]
- [Travel cost between cities is calculated using the Euclidean distance formula.]
- [The goal is to minimize the longest distance between any two consecutive cities visited during the tour.]
- [Output the complete tour as a list of city indices starting and ending at the depot city 0.]
- [Output the total travel cost of the tour.]
- [Output the maximum distance between any two consecutive cities in the tour.]
