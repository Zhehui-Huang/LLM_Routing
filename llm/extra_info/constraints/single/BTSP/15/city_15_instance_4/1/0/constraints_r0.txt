- [The travel cost is calculated as the Euclidean distance between two cities.]
- [The optimization goal is to minimize the longest distance between any two consecutive cities in the tour.]
- [Output the tour as a list of city indices starting and ending at city 0.]
- [Output the total travel cost of the tour.]
- [Output the maximum distance between any two consecutive cities in the tour.]
