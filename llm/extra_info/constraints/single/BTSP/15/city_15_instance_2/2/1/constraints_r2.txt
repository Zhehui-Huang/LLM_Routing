- [The robot must start and end the tour at the depot city, which is city 0.]
- [Each city, from city 1 to city 14, must be visited exactly once by the robot.]
- [The travel cost between two cities is determined using the Euclidean distance.]
- [The goal is to minimize the maximum distance between any two consecutive cities in the robotâ€™s tour.]
- [The output should include the tour as a list of city indices, starting and ending at city 0.]
- [The output should report the total travel cost of the tour.]
- [The output should report the maximum distance between any two consecutive cities in the tour.]
