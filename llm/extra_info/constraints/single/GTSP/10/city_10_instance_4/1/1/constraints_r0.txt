- [There are 10 explicitly defined cities with given coordinates.]
- [There is one depot city, city 0, with coordinates (79, 15).]
- [Cities are divided into 7 groups, and from each group, exactly one city must be visited.]
- [Exactly one robot is available for the task.]
- [The robot must start and end its journey at the depot city.]
- [Travel cost between any two cities is computed using Euclidean distance.]
- [The goal is to determine the shortest possible tour for the robot that meets all constraints.]
- [Output the tour as a list of city indices, beginning and ending at the city index 0.]
- [Output the total travel cost of the complete tour.]
