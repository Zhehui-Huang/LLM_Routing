- [The robot starts and finishes its journey at the depot city, which is city 0.]
- [The robot needs to visit exactly one city from each of the three groups of cities.]
- [The travel routes between any two cities involve the robot, and the travel cost is calculated through the Euclidean distance.]
- [The objective is to determine the shortest possible tour for the robot that visits the required cities and returns to the depot.]
