- [There are 10 cities, uniquely indexed from 0 (depot) to 9.]
- [City coordinates range from (1,1) to (98,98).]
- [There are 3 groups of cities. Each group contains exactly 3 cities. Group 0: [1, 2, 6], Group 1: [3, 7, 8], Group 2: [4, 5, 9].]
- [One robot is available to perform the task. It starts and ends at the depot city 0.]
- [The robot must visit exactly one city from each city group.]
- [Travel cost between two cities is calculated based on the Euclidean distance.]
- [The objective is to minimize the total travel distance of the tour, starting and ending at the depot city 0.]
- [The output should be a tour as a list of city indices starting and ending at city 0, and the total travel cost of the tour.]
