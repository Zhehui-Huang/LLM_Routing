- [Requirement 3] Cities are divided into 7 groups, and the robot must visit exactly one city from each group.
- [Requirement 4] Travel cost is calculated as the Euclidean distance between any two cities.
- [Requirement 5] The objective is to find the shortest tour for the given constraints.
- [Requirement 6] The solution should be expressed as a list of city indices representing the tour in order, starting and ending at city 0 and include the total travel cost of that tour.
