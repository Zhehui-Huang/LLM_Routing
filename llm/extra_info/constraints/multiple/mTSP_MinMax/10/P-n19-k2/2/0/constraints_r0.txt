- [There are 19 cities, including a depot city. The cities are assigned specific coordinates.]
- [Two robots are available to perform the tours from the depot city.]
- [Each robot starts and ends its tour at the depot city.]
- [Robots must visit each city exactly once, excluding the depot city.]
- [The objective is to minimize the maximum distance traveled by any single robot.]
- [Travel cost is computed using the Euclidean distance between cities.]
- [Output should include the tours for each robot, starting and ending at the depot, along with the travel cost for each tour and the maximum travel cost among all tours.]
