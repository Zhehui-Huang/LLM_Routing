- [There are 19 specific cities including the starting point, which is the depot city.]
- [Coordinates for each city are predefined.]
- [There are 2 robots available for the task.]
- [All robots start their journey from the same depot city, which is city 0.]
- [Robots have the ability to travel between any two cities.]
- [Travel cost between cities is defined by the Euclidean distance.]
- [Every city, except for the depot, must be visited exactly once by the robots.]
- [Each robot's tour must start and end at the depot city.]
- [The main objective is to minimize the maximum distance traveled by any single robot.]
- [Output should include specific tours for each robot and the total travel cost for each tour.]
- [Output must also report the maximum travel cost among all tours.]
