- [Each robot must visit all assigned cities exactly once and return to the depot city 0.]
- [All cities, except the depot, are visited exactly once collectively by all robots.]
- [The travel cost between any two cities is calculated using the Euclidean distance.]
- [The primary objective is to minimize the maximum distance traveled by any single robot.]
- [Output must include the tour and travel cost for each robot, and the maximum travel cost among all tours.]
- [Each tour should start and end at the depot city 0.]
