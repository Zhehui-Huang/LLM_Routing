- [Requirement 1]: There are 23 cities, each identified with a unique index and corresponding coordinates.
- [Requirement 2]: There are 8 robots, all starting from the depot city (index 0). Each robot needs to start and end its tour at the depot city.
- [Requirement 3]: The robots must collectively visit all cities exactly once, excluding the depot.
- [Requirement 4]: The primary objective is to minimize the maximum distance traveled by any single robot.
- [Requirement 5]: Travel cost is calculated as the Euclidean distance between two cities.
- [Requirement 6]: Output the tours for each robot in the format of a list of city indices, starting and ending at the depot.
- [Requirement 7]: Output the travel cost for each tour and the maximum travel cost among all tours.
