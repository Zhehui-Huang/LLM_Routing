- [There are 16 cities, including the depot city (City 0).]
- [City coordinates are provided, and the depot city is located at coordinates (30, 40).]
- [There are 8 robots, and all start at the depot city 0.]
- [Robots can travel between any two cities.]
- [Travel cost is calculated as the Euclidean distance between two cities.]
- [Each robot must start and end its tour at the depot city 0.]
- [Each city, except for the depot, must be visited exactly once by the robots collectively.]
- [The main objective is to minimize the maximum distance traveled by any single robot.]
- [Output should list the tours for each robot starting and ending at city 0.]
- [Output should include the travel cost for each tour.]
- [Output should specify the maximum travel cost among all the tours.]
