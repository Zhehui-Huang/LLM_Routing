- [Each robot must start and end its tour at the depot city.]
- [Each city, except the depot, must be visited exactly once by the robots collectively.]
- [The primary objective is to minimize the maximum distance traveled by any single robot.]
- [The travel cost between two cities is calculated as the Euclidean distance.]
- [The output must include each robot's tour, beginning and ending at the depot city, and their respective travel costs.]
- [The output must specify the maximum travel cost among all the robots' tours.]
