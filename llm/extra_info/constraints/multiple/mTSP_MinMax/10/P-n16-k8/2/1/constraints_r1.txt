- [Requirement 1] There are 16 cities, including a depot city (city 0). Each robot's tour should start and end at the depot city.
- [Requirement 2] All cities, except the depot city, must be visited exactly once by the robots collectively.
- [Requirement 3] The primary objective is to minimize the maximum distance traveled by any single robot, where distance is calculated as the Euclidean distance between cities.
- [Requirement 4] Output the tours for each robot in the form of a list of city indices, starting and ending at the depot city.
- [Requirement 5] Output the travel cost for each tour and identify the maximum travel cost among all tours.
