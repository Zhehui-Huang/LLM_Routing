- [Requirement 1] There are 16 cities including the depot city, and each city is associated with specific coordinates.
- [Requirement 2] Eight robots are available, all starting from the depot city (city 0), and must end their tours at the same city.
- [Requirement 3] Distance between cities is measured using the Euclidean distance.
- [Requirement 4] Each city, except the depot, must be visited exactly once by the robots collectively.
- [Requirement 5] The goal is to minimize the maximum distance traveled by any single robot in their tour.
- [Requirement 6] The final output should list the routes and travel costs for each robot and state the maximum travel cost among all the robots' tours.
