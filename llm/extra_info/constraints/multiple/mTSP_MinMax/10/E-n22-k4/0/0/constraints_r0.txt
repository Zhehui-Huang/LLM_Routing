- [There are 22 cities with given coordinates, including a depot city]
- [There are 4 robots available with IDs starting from 0]
- [All robots start and end their tours at the depot city]
- [The travel cost between any two cities is the Euclidean distance]
- [Each city, except the depot, must be visited exactly once by any of the robots]
- [The primary objective is to minimize the maximum distance traveled by any single robot]
- [Output each robot’s tour as a list of city indices, starting and ending at the depot city]
- [Output the travel cost for each robot’s tour]
- [Output the maximum travel cost among all tours]
