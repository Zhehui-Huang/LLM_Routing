- [All cities must be visited exactly once by the robots, excluding the depot city as a destination.]
- [Each robot must start and end its tour at the depot city.]
- [The primary objective is to minimize the maximum distance traveled by any single isiting robot.]
- [Travel cost between any two cities is calculated as the Euclidean distance.]
- [Each robot's tour should be outputted as a list of city indices starting and ending at the depot city 0.]
- [You need to output the travel cost for each robot tour and the maximum travel cost among all tours.]
