- [Minimize the maximum distance traveled by any single robot.]
- [Travel cost is determined by the Euclidean distance between two cities.]
- [Output the individual tours for each robot, starting and ending at the depot.]
- [Output the travel cost for each tour.]
- [Output the maximum travel cost among all the tours.]
