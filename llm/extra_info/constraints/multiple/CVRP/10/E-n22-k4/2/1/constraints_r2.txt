- [There are 22 cities including a depot city (city 0).]
- [Each city, including the depot, is represented by its geographical coordinates for distance calculations.]
- [Each city has a set demand for goods, with the depot city (city 0)'s demand being 0.]
- [There are 4 robots available for delivering goods.]
- [Each robot has a carrying capacity of 6000 units.]
- [All robots start and end their route at the depot city (city 0).]
- [Travel costs between cities are defined by the Euclidean distance between their coordinates.]
- [Each city's demand must be exactly satisfied by the sum of goods delivered by the robots.]
- [The sum of all goods delivered by a robot must not exceed that robot's carrying capacity.]
- [The objective is to minimize the total travel cost for all tours combined.]
- [Each robot's tour is required to be a sequence of city indices starting and ending with the depot city (city 0).]
- [Output should include each robot's tour path, the total travel cost for each tour, and the combined total travel cost of all tours.]
