- [There are 22 cities including the depot city.]
- [Each city, excluding the depot city, has a specific demand that must be met.]
- [There are 4 robots with a capacity of 6000 each.]
- [All robots start and end their routes at the depot city 0.]
- [Travel cost is calculated as the Euclidean distance between two cities.]
- [The objective is to minimize the total travel cost for all robot tours.]
- [Demand of each city must be fully met.]
- [Capacity constraints of the robots must not be exceeded.]
- [Each robotâ€™s tour is a list of city indices starting and ending at city 0.]
- [Output must include tours for each robot, the total travel cost for each tour, and the overall total travel travel cost.]
