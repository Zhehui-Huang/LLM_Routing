- [23 cities, depot at city 0 with coordinates (30, 40)]
- [City coordinates and indices provided, from city 1 to city 22]
- [Demands for each city provided, all demands must be fulfilled]
- [8 robots, each with a carrying capacity of 40, all starting at depot city 0]
- [Travel is possible between any two cities]
- [Travel cost is the Euclidean distance between two cities]
- [Each robot's tour must start and end at the depot city]
- [Each city's demand should be met]
- [The robots' carrying capacity should not be exceeded]
- [Objective: Minimize the total travel cost for all tours]
- [Output should include detailed tours and costs for each robot, and overall cost]
