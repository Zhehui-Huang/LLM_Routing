- [Requirement 6] After completing their deliveries, robots must return to the depot city.
- [Requirement 7] The tours for each robot should start and end at the depot city.
- [Requirement 8] The objective is to minimize the total travel cost for all tours.
- [Requirement 9] The capacity constraints of the robots must not be exceeded when planning the tours.
