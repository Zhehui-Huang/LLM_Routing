- [Requirement 1] All robots begin and end their tours at the depot city 0.
- [Requirement 2] The total demands of all cities excluding the depot must be met exactly by the delivery load of the robots.
- [Requirement 3] None of the robots may exceed their carrying capacity of 40 units per tour.
- [Requirement 4] The objective is to minimize the total travel cost for all the tours collectively.
- [Requirement 5] Each tour should be represented as a list of city indices starting and ending with the depot city 0.
- [Requirement 6] Provide the total travel cost for each tour, and the cumulative total for all tours.
- [Requirement 7] The travel cost between cities is measured by the Euclidean distance between their coordinates.
- [Requirement 8] Each robot can travel between any two cities directly.
- [Requirement 9] There are a total of 8 robots available for distribution of goods.
- [Requirement 10] Each robot must comply with the logistics constraints set by the problem when planning their tour.
