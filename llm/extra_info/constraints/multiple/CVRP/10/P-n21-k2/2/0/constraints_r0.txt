- [Each robot must start and end their tour at the depot city 0.]
- [Each city's demand must be fully met by the deliveries from the robots.]
- [The capacity constraints of each robot must not be exceeded.]
- [The objective is to minimize the total travel cost for all tours combined.]
- [Given demands and cities, operational tours must be formed accordingly.]
- [Robots can travel between any two cities.]
- [Travel cost is calculated as the Euclidean distance between two cities.]
