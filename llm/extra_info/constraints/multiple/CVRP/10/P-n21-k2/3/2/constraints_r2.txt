- [There are 21 cities including the depot city, each with specified coordinates.]
- [City 0 is the depot city, where all tours start and end.]
- [Demands are specified for each city, with city 0 having a demand of 0.]
- [There are 2 robots available to perform the deliveries.]
- [Each robot has a carrying capacity of 160 units.]
- [All robots start their tours at the depot city 0.]
- [Robots can travel between any two cities.]
- [Travel cost between cities is calculated using the Euclidean distance formula.]
- [Tours require each robot to deliver goods to each city, fully meeting the city's demand.]
- [Tours must ensure that the capacity constraints of the robots are not exceeded.]
- [The objective is to minimize the total travel cost for all robot tours.]
