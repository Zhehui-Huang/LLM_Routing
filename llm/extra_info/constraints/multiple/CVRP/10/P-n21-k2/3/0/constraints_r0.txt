- [Each robot's tour must start and end at depot city 0.]
- [Each city's demand must be met exactly.]
- [All cities, excluding the depot, must be visited at least once.]
- [The carrying capacity of each robot must not be exceeded.]
- [Travel cost between cities is computed as the Euclidean distance.]
- [The objective is to minimize the total travel cost for all tours.]
