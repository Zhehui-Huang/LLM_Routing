- [There are 16 cities, including a depot city.]
- [The cities are uniquely identified by indices (0 to 15), with city 0 being the depot.]
- [Cities are associated with specific coordinates.]
- [There are 8 robots, each identified from 0 to 7.]
- [All robots start at the depot city 0.]
- [Each robot must visit each city exactly once, excluding the depot as a destination, and return to the depot.]
- [Travel cost between cities is calculated using the Euclidean distance formula.]
- [The objective is to minimize the total travel cost across all robots.]
- [The tours and total travel costs for each robot need to be outputted, as well as the overall total travel cost.]
