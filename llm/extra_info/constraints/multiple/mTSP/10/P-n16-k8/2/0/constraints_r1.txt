- [There are 16 cities, including the depot city.]
- [Cities have set coordinates.]
- [Number of robots: 8, starting from depot city 0.]
- [All robots start and end their tour at depot city 0.]
- [Travel is calculated using Euclidean distance between two cities.]
- [Robots must collectively visit all cities exactly once, except the depot city.]
- [Objective is to minimize the total travel cost for all tours.]
- [Output each robotâ€™s tour as a list of city indices starting and ending at city 0.]
- [Output the total travel cost for each tour and the overall total travel cost.]
