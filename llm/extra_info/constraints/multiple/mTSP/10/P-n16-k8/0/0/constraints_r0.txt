- [Requirement 1] The problem consists of 16 cities with specific coordinates, including depot city 0 at (30, 40).
- [Requirement 2] Eight robots are available, all starting at depot city 0.
- [Requirement 3] Each robot must start and end its tour at the depot city 0.
- [Requirement 4] Robots must collectively visit all cities exactly once, excluding the depot city as a destination.
- [Requirement 5] Travel cost is calculated using the Euclidean distance between cities.
- [Requirement 6] The objective is to minimize the total travel cost of all tours combined.
- [Requirement 7] Output should include the tour path for each robot starting and ending at the depot city 0, the total travel cost for each tour, and the overall total travel cost.
