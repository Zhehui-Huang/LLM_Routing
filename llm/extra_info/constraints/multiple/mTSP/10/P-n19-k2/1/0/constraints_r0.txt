- [There are 19 cities including a depot city.]
- [City coordinates are provided for each city, including the depot.]
- [There are 2 robots available for use.]
- [All robots start at the depot city, city index 0.]
- [Robots can travel between any two cities.]
- [Travel costs are calculated based on the Euclidean distance between cities.]
- [Robots must collectively visit all cities exactly once, excluding the depot city as a destination, and then return to the depot city after completing their tours.]
- [Each robot's tour should start and end at the depot city 0.]
- [The objective is to determine the shortest possible tours for the robots while minimizing the total travel cost.]
- [Output should include the tours for each robot as a list of city indices and the total travel cost for each tour, plus the overall total travel system cost.]
