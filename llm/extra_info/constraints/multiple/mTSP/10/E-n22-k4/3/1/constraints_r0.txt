- [There are 22 cities including a depot city labeled as city 0.]
- [Each robot must start and end its tour at the depot city 0.]
- [All robots start their journey from the depot city.]
- [There are four robots available for the task.]
- [Robots can travel between any two cities.]
- [Travel cost is the Euclidean distance between cities.]
- [Each city, except the depot city, must be visited exactly once by the robots collectively.]
- [The objective is to minimize the total travel cost while ensuring all cities are visited.]
- [Output should include the tour for each robot and the total travel cost for each tour as well as the overall total travel cost.]
