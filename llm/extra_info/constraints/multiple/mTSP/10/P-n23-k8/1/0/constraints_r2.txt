- [23 cities are present with a depot city identified as city 0.]
- [Robots must start and end their tours at the depot city.]
- [Robots must collectively visit all other cities exactly once, without counting the depot city as a destination.]
- [There are 8 robots available for the task.]
- [The travel cost between any two cities is determined by the Euclidean distance.]
- [The objective is to minimize the total travel cost of all robot tours.]
