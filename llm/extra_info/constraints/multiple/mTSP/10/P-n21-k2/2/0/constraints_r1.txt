- [Requirement 1] There are 21 cities with assigned coordinates, of which City 0 is the depot.
- [Requirement 2] Two robots are available, both start at depot City 0.
- [Requirement 3] The objective is to determine the shortest possible tours for each robot, with every city except the depot visited exactly once collectively by the robots.
- [Requirement 4] Each robot must start and end its tour at the depot.
- [Requirement 5] The travel cost is the Euclidean distance between any two cities.
- [Requirement 6] Each city, except the depot, must be visited exactly once by the robots.
- [Requirement 7] The output should list the tours for each robot as a sequence of visited city indices starting and ending at the depot, plus the travel cost for each tour and the overall total travel cost.
