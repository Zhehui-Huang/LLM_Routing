- [Requirement 1] There are 21 cities, including two depot cities at index 0 and 1.
- [Requirement 2] There are two robots, both starting at depot city 0.
- [Requirement 3] Travel cost between cities is calculated using the Euclidean distance.
- [Requirement 4] Robots need to collectively visit all cities exactly once.
- [Requirement 5] Each robot starts its route from the designated depot city (depot city 0 for both robots in this scenario).
- [Requirement 6] Robots do not need to return to the depot after completing their tours.
- [Requirement 7] The robots can stop at any city as their endpoint.
- [Requirement 8] The goal is to determine the shortest tours for each robot while minimizing the total combined travel cost of the robots.
- [Requirement 9] Output for each robot should include the tour's path as a list of city indices and the total travel cost for that tour.
- [Requirement 10] Output should also include the combined total travel cost of all robots.
