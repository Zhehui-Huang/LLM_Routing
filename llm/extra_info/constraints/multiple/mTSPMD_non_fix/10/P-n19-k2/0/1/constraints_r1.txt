- [There are 19 cities, including two depot cities and 17 other cities.]
- [The coordinates for each city are provided, and these are used to calculate travel distances.]
- [There are two robots available, each starting from depot city 0.]
- [The travel cost between cities is calculated using the Euclidean distance.]
- [Robots need to visit all cities exactly once between them.]
- [Each robot starts from depot city 0 but does not need to return to the depot at the end of its tour.]
- [The goal is to minimize the total combined travel cost of both robots.]
- [The solution should provide distinct tours for each robot, ensuring no city is visited more than once across all tours.]
- [Output should list tours for each robot starting and ending at their assigned depot, include the total travel cost for each tour, and the overall total travel cost.]
