- [Number of cities: 19 including 2 depot cities with defined coordinates]
- [Cities have unique indices ranging from 0 to 18 where 0 and 1 are depot cities]
- [Two robots available for the task, both starting from depot city 0]
- [Robots can travel between any two cities]
- [Travel cost is the Euclidean distance between cities]
- [Each city must be visited exactly once by any of the robots]
- [Each robot starts its tour from the depot city 0 and ends at any city; returning to the depot is not mandatory]
- [The objective is to optimize the tours to minimize the total combined travel cost of all robots]
- [Output should include the tour for each robot starting and ending at its assigned depot, individual travel costs for each tour, and the total combined cost]
