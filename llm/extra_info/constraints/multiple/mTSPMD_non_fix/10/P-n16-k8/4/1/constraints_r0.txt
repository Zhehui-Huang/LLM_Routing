- [There are 16 cities total, including 8 depot cities where robots can start.]
- [All 8 robots start from depot city 0.]
- [Robots can travel between any two cities.]
- [Travel cost between cities is calculated using the Euclidean distance.]
- [Each robot must visit each city exactly once; all cities must be collectively visited once by the robots.]
- [Robots do not need to return to a depot city after completing their tour.]
- [The aim is to minimize the total travel cost for all robots combined.]
- [Output should display tours for each robot as lists of visited city indices, starting and finishing at their designated depot.]
- [Output should include individual total travel costs for each robotâ€™s tour, and also the combined total travel cost for all robots.]
