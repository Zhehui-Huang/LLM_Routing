- [Each robot starts and ends at its designated depot city.]
- [All robots must collectively visit each city exactly once.]
- [The objective is to minimize the total travel cost for all robots combined.]
- [Travel costs between cities are calculated using the Euclidean distance.]
- [Output should include each robot's tour beginning and ending at its depot, the individual travel cost for each robot, and the overall total travel cost.]
