- [Requirement 1] There are two robots, each starting and ending at different depot cities. Robot 0 starts and ends at city 0, and Robot 1 starts and ends at city 1.
- [Requirement 2] Each robot must collectively visit all cities exactly once, ensuring that no city besides the depots is visited more than once across both robots.
- [Requirement 3] The objective is to determine the shortest possible tours for each robot while minimizing the total travel cost for all robots combined. Each tour must start and end at the robot's assigned depot.
