- [Requirement 1]: There are 21 total cities, with specific coordinates given, including two depot cities.
- [Requirement 2]: There are two robots, each starting and ending at a designated depot city (Robot 0 starts and ends at depot city 0, Robot 1 starts and ends at depot city 1).
- [Requirement 3]: Robots must visit each city exactly once and return to their respective depots.
- [Requirement 4]: Robot travel cost is the Euclidean distance between cities they travel between.
- [Requirement 5]: The objective is to determine the shortest possible tours for each robot while minimizing the total combined travel cost for all robots.
- [Requirement 6]: Output should specify the tours and travel costs for both robots individually and the combined overall cost, starting and ending each tour at the respective robot's depot.
