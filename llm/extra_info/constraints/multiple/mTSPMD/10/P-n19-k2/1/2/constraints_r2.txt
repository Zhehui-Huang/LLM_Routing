- [There are a total of 19 cities, including two depot cities.]
- [Depot city 0 is (30, 40), Depot city 1 is (37, 52).]
- [There are exactly 2 robots. Robot 0 starts and ends at Depot 0, Robot 1 starts and ends at Depot 1.]
- [Robots can travel between any two cities.]
- [Travel cost is calculated using the Euclidean distance formula between coordinates of two cities.]
- [Each city must be visited exactly once by the robots collectively.]
- [Each robot must return to its starting depot after completing its tour.]
- [The objective is to minimize the total combined travel cost of all robots.]
- [Output the tours for each robot as a list of city indices, starting and ending at their respective depots.]
- [Output the total travel cost for each robot's tour and also the overall total cost combining both robots.]
