- [Each robot must visit all cities exactly once then return to their respective depots.]
- [City visits must be performed collectively by all robots.]
- [The same city cannot be visited by more than one robot.]
- [Each tour must start and end at the robot's assigned depot.]
- [The objective is to minimize the total travel cost for all robots combined.]
- [Travel cost is calculated using the Euclidean distance between two cities.]
