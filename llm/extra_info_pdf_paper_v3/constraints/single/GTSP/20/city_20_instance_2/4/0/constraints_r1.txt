- [There are 20 cities including the depot city (city 0).]
- [City coordinates are provided for all cities.]
- [Cities are divided into 5 groups.]
- [The robot starts at depot city 0.]
- [The robot needs to visit exactly one city from each group.]
- [The robot must return to the depot city after visiting all selected cities.]
- [Travel cost is calculated using the Euclidean distance between cities.]
- [The desired solution should use some adaptation of the Lin-Kernighan Heuristic for GTSP.]
- [The robot is to complete the task in the shortest possible tour.]
- [Tour output should be in the form of a list of city indices starting and ending at city 0.]
- [The output should also provide the total travel cost of the tour.]
