- [Requirement 1] The robot starts and ends the tour at the depot city (index 0).
- [Requirement 2] The robot must visit exactly one city from each of the three city groups during the tour.
- [Requirement 3] The city groups are defined as follows: Group 0: [2, 7, 10, 11, 14], Group 1: [1, 3, 5, 8, 13], Group 2: [4, 6, 9, 12].
- [Requirement 4] Travel cost between cities is computed using the Euclidean distance.
- [Requirement 5] The solution must determine the shortest total travel distance for the robot's complete tour.
- [Requirement 6] Output of the solution should be in the format: Tour list of cities starting and ending at depot, and total tour travel cost.
