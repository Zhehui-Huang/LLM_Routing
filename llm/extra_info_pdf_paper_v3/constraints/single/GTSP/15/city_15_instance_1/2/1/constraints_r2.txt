- [The environment includes a total of 15 cities, including the depot city 0.]
- [City coordinates range from (4, 1) to (98, 96).]
- [There are 4 city groups, each group contains a specific set of city indices.]
- [One robot is available for accomplishing the task.]
- [The robot starts and ends its journey at the depot city 0.]
- [The robot can only visit one city from each group, resulting in a total of 4 visited cities (excluding the depot).]
- [Travel costs are calculated using the Euclidean distance between cities.]
- [The objective is to determine the shortest tour visiting one city from each group and returning to the depot.]
- [The output should include the tour as a list of city indices, starting and ending at city 0, and the total travel cost.]
