- [There are 10 cities, including the depot city (city 0).]
- [The coordinates of the cities are given as depot city 0: (50, 42), city 1: (41, 1), city 2: (18, 46), city 3: (40, 98), city 4: (51, 69), city 5: (47, 39), city 6: (62, 26), city 7: (79, 31), city 8: (61, 90), city 9: (42, 49).]
- [The cities are grouped into three groups: Group 0 contains cities [1, 2, 6], Group 1 contains cities [3, 7, 8], and Group 2 contains cities [4, 5, 9].]
- [There is one robot available for the task.]
- [The robot starts and ends its journey at the depot city 0.]
- [The robot can travel directly between any two cities.]
- [Travel cost between cities is calculated using the Euclidean distance formula given two city coordinates.]
- [The robot needs to visit exactly one city from each group and return to the depot, constituting one city from each group 0, 1, and 2 and, respectively.]
- [The task requires finding the shortest possible tour that satisfies the visiting constraints.]
- [The output should start and end at the depot city 0 and include the city indices in the order visited.]
- [Additionally, the total travel cost of the tour should be provided.]
