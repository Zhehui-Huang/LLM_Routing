- [The environment consists of 10 cities with specified coordinates.]
- [There is one robot that starts at depot city 0 and can travel between any two cities.]
- [Travel cost is calculated as the Euclidean distance between two cities.]
- [There are 6 city groups with specified city memberships.]
- [The robot needs to visit exactly one city from each group of cities, forming a tour starting and ending at the depot city 0.]
