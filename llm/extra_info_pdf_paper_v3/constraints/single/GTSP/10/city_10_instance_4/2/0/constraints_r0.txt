- [The robot must start and end its journey at the depot city indexed as 0.]
- [The robot must visit exactly one city from each defined group of cities.]
- [The travel cost is calculated using the Euclidean distance between two cities.]
- [There are 7 city groups and the robot must visit one city from each group making a total of 7 distinct visits, excluding the depot city.]
- [Output of the solution should be the tour as a list of city indices starting and ending at city 0 and the total travel cost of this tour.]
