- [The robot must start and end its tour at the depot city, which is city 0.]
- [The robot must visit each city exactly once, excluding the depot city which it visits twice (start and end).]
- [Travel cost between cities is calculated based on the Euclidean distance between their coordinates.]
- [The goal is to minimize the longest distance between any two consecutive cities in the tour.]
