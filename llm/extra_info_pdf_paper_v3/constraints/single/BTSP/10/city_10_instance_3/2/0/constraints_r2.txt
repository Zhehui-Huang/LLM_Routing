- [There are 10 cities with specified coordinates including a depot city 0.]
- [The robot starts at depot city 0 and must visit each city exactly once, starting and ending at the depot city.]
- [Travel cost is calculated as the Euclidean distance between any two cities.]
- [The goal is to minimize the longest distance between any two consecutive cities in the city tour.]
- [Output should include the tour as a list of city indices starting and ending at city 0, the total travel cost, and the maximum distance between any two consecutive cities in the tour.]
