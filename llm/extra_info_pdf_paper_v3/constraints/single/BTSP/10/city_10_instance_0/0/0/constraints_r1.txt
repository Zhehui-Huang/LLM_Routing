- [The robot needs to start and end the tour at depot city 0.]
- [The robot must visit each city exactly once.]
- [Travel between cities is calculated based on Euclidean distance.]
- [The goal is to minimize the longest distance between any two consecutive cities in the tour.]
- [Output should include the tour as a list of city indices, with the tour starting and ending at city 0.]
- [Output should include the total travel cost of the tour.]
- [Output should include the maximum distance between any two consecutive cities in the tour.]
