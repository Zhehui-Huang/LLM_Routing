- [There are 10 cities, each with specified coordinates]
- [There is one robot starting at depot city 0]
- [Robot must visit each city exactly once, starting and ending at the depot city]
- [Travel cost between cities is computed as the Euclidean distance]
- [The goal is to minimize the longest distance between any two consecutive cities in the tour]
- [Output the tour as a list of city indices, starting and ending at the depot city]
- [Output the total travel cost of the tour]
- [Output the maximum distance between any two consecutive cities in the tour]
