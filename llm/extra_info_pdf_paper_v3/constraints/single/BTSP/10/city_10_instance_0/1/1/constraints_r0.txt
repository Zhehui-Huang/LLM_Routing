- [The robot must start and end at the depot city, which is city 0.]
- [The robot needs to visit each of the 10 cities exactly once.]
- [Travel cost between cities is calculated using the Euclidean distance.]
- [The solution should aim to minimize the longest distance between any two consecutive cities in the tour.]
- [The final output should include the tour route starting and ending at city 0, the total travel cost of the tour, and the maximum distance between any two consecutive cities.]
