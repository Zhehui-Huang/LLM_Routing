- [The robot must start and end its tour at city 0 (the depot city).]
- [The robot must visit each city exactly once, apart from the depot city which must be visited twice (start and end).]
- [The cost of traveling between two cities is calculated using the Euclidean distance.]
- [The goal is to minimize the maximum distance between any two consecutive cities in the tour.]
