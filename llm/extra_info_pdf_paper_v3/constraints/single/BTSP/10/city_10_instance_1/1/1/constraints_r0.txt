- [The robot must start and end its tour at the depot city 0.]
- [The robot must visit each city exactly once.]
- [The goal is to minimize the longest distance between any two consecutive cities in the tour.]
- [The travel cost between two cities is calculated as the Euclidean distance.]
- [The output should include the tour as a list of city indices starting and ending at city 0.]
- [The output should include the total travel cost of the tour.]
- [The output should include the maximum distance between any two consecutive cities in the tour.]
