- [There are 10 cities, including the depot city 0.]
- [The robot begins its journey at depot city 0.]
- [Each city must be visited exactly once by the robot, after which it returns to the depot city 0.]
- [The travel cost between cities is calculated as the Euclidean distance.]
- [The goal is to minimize the longest distance between any two consecutive cities in the tour.]
- [Output the tour as a list of city indices starting and ending at depot city 0.]
- [Output the total travel cost of the tour.]
- [Output the maximum distance between any two consecutive cities in the tour.]
