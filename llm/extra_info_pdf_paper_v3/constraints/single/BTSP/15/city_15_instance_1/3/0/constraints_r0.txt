- [There are 15 cities, including a depot city.]
- [The robot starts and ends its tour at the depot city (city 0).]
- [The robot must visit each city exactly once.]
- [Travel cost between two cities is calculated using the Euclidean distance.]
- [The goal is to minimize the longest distance between any two consecutive cities in the tour.]
- [Output should include the tour as a list of city indices starting and ending at city 0.]
- [Output should include the total travel cost of the tour.]
- [Output should include the maximum distance between any two consecutive cities in the tour.]
