- [Each city must be visited exactly once by the robot.]
- [Travel cost between cities is calculated using the Euclidean distance formula.]
- [The objective is to minimize the longest distance between any two consecutive cities in the robot's tour.]
- [Output should include the tour as a list of city indices, total travel cost, and maximum distance between two consecutive cities.]
