- [The robot must start and end its journey at the depot city 0.]
- [The robot must visit each city exactly once, except the depot city which needs to be visited twice (starting and ending points).]
- [Travel cost between two cities is calculated using the Euclidean distance.]
- [The goal is to minimize the longest distance between any two consecutive cities in the tour.]
- [Output should include the tour as a list of city indices.]
- [Output should include the total travel cost of the tour.]
- [Output should include the maximum distance between any two consecutive cities.]
- [All calculations must be precise to ensure accurate results in matching theoretical solutions.]
