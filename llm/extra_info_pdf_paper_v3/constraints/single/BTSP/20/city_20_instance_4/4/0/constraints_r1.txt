- [The robot must start and end the tour at depot city (City 0).]
- [The robot must visit each city exactly once.]
- [The objective is to minimize the longest distance between any two consecutive cities in the tour.]
- [The travel cost between two cities is calculated as the Euclidean distance.]
- [Output should include the complete travel tour starting and ending at the depot city.]
- [Output should include the total travel cost of the tour.]
- [Output should include the maximum distance between any two consecutive cities in the tour.]
