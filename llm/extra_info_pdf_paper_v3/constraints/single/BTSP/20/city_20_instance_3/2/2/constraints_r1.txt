- [Requirement 1] The robot must start and end at depot city 0.
- [Requirement 2] The robot needs to visit each city exactly once.
- [Requirement 3] The robot can travel between any two cities, using the Euclidean distance as the travel cost.
- [Requirement 4] The objective is to minimize the longest distance between any two consecutive cities in the tour.
- [Requirement 5] Output the tour as a list of city indices starting and ending at depot city 0.
- [Requirement 6] Output the total travel cost of the tour.
- [Requirement 7] Output the maximum distance between any two consecutive cities in the tour.
- [Requirement 8] Employ an approximation algorithm due to the NP-completeness of the problem.
- [Requirement 9] Consider using the concepts from the article on approximation algorithms and bottleneck problems to address the task.
