- [Requirement 2] Each city must be visited exactly once by the robot, except the depot city, which is visited twice (start and end).
- [Requirement 3] The travel cost between cities is calculated using the Euclidean distance.
- [Requirement 4] The solution must aim to minimize the longest distance between any two consecutive cities in the tour.
- [Requirement 5] Output the tour as a list of city indices starting and ending at the depot city.
- [Requirement 6] Output the total travel cost of the tour.
- [Requirement 7] Output the maximum distance between any two consecutive cities in the tour.
