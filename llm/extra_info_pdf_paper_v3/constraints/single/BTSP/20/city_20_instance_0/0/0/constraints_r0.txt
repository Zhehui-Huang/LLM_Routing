- [The robot must start and end the tour at depot city 0.]
- [Each city must be visited exactly once by the robot, except the depot city 0 which must be visited twice (start and end).]
- [The goal is to minimize the longest distance between any two consecutive cities in the tour.]
- [Travel cost between cities is calculated using the Euclidean distance formula.]
- [Output should include the tour as a list of city indices, the total travel cost of the tour, and the maximum distance between any two consecutive cities in the tour.]
