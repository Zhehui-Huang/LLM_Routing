- [Requirement 1]: The robot must start and end its journey at the depot city (city 0).
- [Requirement 2]: The robot is required to visit all cities exactly once, with the exception of the depot city which must be the start and end point.
- [Requirement 3]: The travel cost between any two cities is defined as the Euclidean distance between them.
- [Requirement 4]: Output the solution as a tour list starting and ending at city 0, along with the total travel cost of the tour.
- [Requirement 5]: Implement a heuristic based on constructing a Shortest Spanning Tree (SST), followed by a minimum-cost perfect matching on the subgraph of vertices with odd degrees, and then converting this into a Hamiltonian circuit.
