- [Requirement 1] The robot must start and end the tour at the depot city, which is city 0.
- [Requirement 2] The robot must visit all cities exactly once, excluding the depot city.
- [Requirement 3] The travel cost between any two cities is determined by the Euclidean distance between them.
- [Requirement 4] Output the tour as a list of city indices starting and ending at the depot city.
- [Requirement 5] Output the total travel cost of the tour.
- [Requirement 6] Implement the heuristic algorithm which includes constructing a shortest spanning tree (SST) and finding a minimum-cost perfect matching on a subgraph induced by vertices of odd degree in the SST to solve the problem.
