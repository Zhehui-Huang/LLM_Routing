- [Requirement 1] The solution must involve visiting all cities exactly once, excluding the depot city which must be both the start and end of the tour.
- [Requirement 2] The travel cost between cities is calculated using the Euclidean distance formula.
- [Requirement 3] Output the results as a list of city indices representing the tour starting and ending at the depot city (0), and also output the total travel cost of that tour.
