- [There are 20 cities, including the depot city labeled as city 0.]
- [The robot starts at the depot city 0.]
- [The robot needs to visit all cities exactly once, except the depot city, and then return to the depot city.]
- [The travel cost is calculated as the Euclidean distance between the two cities.]
- [The output should list the tour as a list of city indices, starting and ending at the depot city 0.]
