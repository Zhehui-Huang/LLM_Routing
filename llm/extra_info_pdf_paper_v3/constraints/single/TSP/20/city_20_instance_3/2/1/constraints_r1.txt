- [Requirement 1] The robot must start and end the tour at the depot city, which is city 0.
- [Requirement 2] The robot must visit all cities exactly once, except for the depot city, and then return to the depot city.
- [Requirement 3] The travel cost between any two cities is calculated using the Euclidean distance.
- [Requirement 4] The output must be formatted as a list of city indices representing the tour, starting and ending at the depot city, and the total travel cost of the tour.
- [Requirement 5] Implement a solution that employs a heuristic method as described, involving a shortest spanning tree and a minimum-cost perfect matching for vertices with odd degree in the spanning tree to approximate the shortest tour efficiently.
- [Requirement 6] The heuristic method should attempt to achieve a tour cost no more than 3/2 times the cost of an optimal tour.
