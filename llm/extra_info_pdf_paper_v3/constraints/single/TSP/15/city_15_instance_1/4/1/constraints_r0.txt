- [Requirement 1] The robot must start and end at the depot city 0.
- [Requirement 2] Each city (except the depot) must be visited exactly once by the robot.
- [Requirement 3] The travel cost between any two cities is calculated using the Euclidean distance.
- [Requirement 4] The output should be formatted to include both the tour as a list of city indices starting and ending at the depot city 0, and the total travel cost of that tour.
- [Requirement 5] The solution should be based on a heuristic method described by combining a shortest spanning tree, a minimum-cost perfect matching on a subgraph, and conversion to a Hamiltonian circuit as per the insights provided in the task.
