- [The robot starts at the depot city, 0.]
- [The robot must visit each of the other cities exactly once.]
- [After visiting all cities, the robot must return to the depot city, 0.]
- [Travel costs are calculated based on the Euclidean distance between two cities.]
- [The output should include both the tour (a list of city indices starting and ending at the depot) and the total travel cost.]
