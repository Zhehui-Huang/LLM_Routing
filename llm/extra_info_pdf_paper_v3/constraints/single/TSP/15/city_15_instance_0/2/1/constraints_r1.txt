- [Requirement 1] There are 15 cities including the depot. Each city has a unique identifier (0 to 14) and is specified by a coordinate pair (x, y).
- [Requirement 2] The depot city is city 0 with coordinates (9, 93).
- [Requirement 3] The robot starts and ends the tour at the depot city 0.
- [Requirement 4] The robot must visit each city exactly once, except the depot city, on its tour.
- [Requirement 5] The travel cost between two cities is computed based on the Euclidean distance between their coordinates.
- [Requirement 6] The aim is to find the shortest tour that the robot can take to visit all the cities and return to the depot.
- [Requirement 7] The output must include the tour as a list of city indices starting and ending at the depot city 0, and the total travel cost of the tour.
