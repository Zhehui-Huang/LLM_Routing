- [There are 15 cities, including the depot city (City 0).]
- [Depot city 0 coordinates: (9, 93).]
- [Coordinates for other cities range from City 1 to City 14.]
- [There is one robot that starts its journey at the depot city 0.]
- [The robot must visit each city exactly once, excluding the depot.]
- [The robot must return to the depot city after visiting all other cities.]
- [Travel cost between any two cities is calculated using the Euclidean distance.]
- [Output the tour as a list of city indices starting and ending at the depot city 0.]
- [Output the total travel cost of the tour.]
- [The heuristic algorithm involves constructing a shortest spanning tree (SST) and finding a minimum-cost perfect matching on a subgraph induced by vertices of odd degree in the SST.]
