- [Constraint 1] There are 15 cities with specific coordinates, including a depot city.
- [Constraint 2] The robot must start and end the tour at the depot city (City 0).
- [Constraint 3] The robot must visit all cities exactly once, except for the depot city (City 0).
- [Constraint 4] The travel cost between two cities is calculated using the Euclidean distance.
- [Constraint 5] The solution must find the shortest possible tour.
- [Constraint 6] The output must be in the format of a tour list starting and ending at the depot city, followed by the total travel cost.
- [Constraint 7] The Heuristic Algorithm suggested utilizes elements of constructing a shortest spanning tree, finding a minimum-cost perfect matching on a subgraph, and transforming into a Hamiltonian circuit.
- [Constraint 8] The result outputs should only include the tour as a list of city indices and the total travel cost without further description or analysis.
