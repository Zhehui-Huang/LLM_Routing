- [Requirement 1] The robot starts at the depot city, which is city 0.
- [Requirement 2] The robot must visit all other cities exactly once.
- [Requirement 3] After visiting all cities, the robot must return to the depot city.
- [Requirement 4] The travel cost between two cities is calculated using the Euclidean distance formula.
- [Requirement 5] The output should be a list representing the tour, starting and ending at city 0.
- [Requirement 6] The output must include the total travel cost of the tour.
- [Requirement 7] Implement a solution with a heuristic approach hinted in the description, aimed to construct a tour with a cost no more than 1.5 times the optimal cost.
