- [The environment contains 10 cities with specific coordinates.]
- [There is one depot city (city 0), and its coordinates are (84, 67).]
- [The robot starts and ends its tour at the depot city 0.]
- [The robot needs to visit exactly 7 cities, including the depot city.]
- [The travel cost is calculated using the Euclidean distance between two cities.]
- [The task is to find the shortest possible tour that visits exactly 7 cities.]
- [The robot can travel between any two cities.]
- [The output should be in the form of a list of city indices, starting and ending at the depot city.]
- [The output should also include the total travel cost of the tour.]
