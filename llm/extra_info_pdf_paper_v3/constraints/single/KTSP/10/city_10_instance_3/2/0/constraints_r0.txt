- [The environment consists of 10 cities with specific coordinates for each city, including the depot city 0.]
- [There is one robot starting at depot city 0, which can travel between any two cities, calculating the cost as Euclidean distance.]
- [The robot must visit exactly 7 cities, including the depot, and the tour must start and end at the depot city 0.]
- [The goal is to find the shortest possible tour that visits exactly 7 cities.]
- [The output must include both the tour as a list of city indices starting and ending at city 0, and the total travel cost of that tour.]
