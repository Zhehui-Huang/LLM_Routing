- [There are 10 cities in total, including the depot city.]
- [Coordinates for depot city 0 are (50, 42).]
- [Coordinates for the cities range from City 1: (41, 1) to City 9: (42, 49).]
- [One robot is available for traveling.]
- [The robot starts at depot city 0 and must complete its tour at this location.]
- [The robot must visit exactly 4 cities, including the depot city.]
- [Travel cost between cities is calculated using the Euclidean distance.]
- [The task is to find the shortest possible tour that visits 4 cities, starting and ending at the depot city.]
