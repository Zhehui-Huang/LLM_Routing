- [The robot must start and end its tour at the depot city, which is city 0.]
- [The tour needs to include exactly 8 cities, counting the depot city.]
- [The travel cost between two cities is calculated using the Euclidean distance.]
- [The goal is to find the shortest possible tour that visits exactly 7 additional cities besides the depot.]
- [The output should be a list where the tour starts and ends at the depot city and includes the total cost of the tour.]
