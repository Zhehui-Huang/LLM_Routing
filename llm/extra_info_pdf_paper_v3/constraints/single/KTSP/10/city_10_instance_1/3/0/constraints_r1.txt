- [There are 10 cities and the coordinates for each city are explicitly defined.]
- [City indices range from 0 to 9, where 0 is the depot city and the starting and ending point for the robot.]
- [The robot starts its journey at depot city 0.]
- [The robot must visit exactly 5 cities on its tour, including the depot city.]
- [Each city can only be visited once per tour.]
- [The robot returns to the depot city (city 0) at the end of the tour.]
- [Travel cost between two cities is calculated based on the Euclidean distance between their coordinates.]
- [The goal is to find the shortest possible tour that satisfies these conditions.]
