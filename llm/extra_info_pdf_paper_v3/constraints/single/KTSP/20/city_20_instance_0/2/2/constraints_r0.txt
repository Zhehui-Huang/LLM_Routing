- [The environment comprises 20 cities, each with a specific coordinate position.]
- [The depot, city 0, has coordinates (8, 11).]
- [There is one robot starting its journey at the depot city 0.]
- [The robot must start and end its tour at the depot city 0.]
- [The robot can travel between any two cities.]
- [Travel cost between cities is calculated based on the Euclidean distance.]
- [The objective is to find a tour for the robot that visits exactly 4 cities out of the 20 available, including the depot.]
- [The goal is to minimize the total travel distance of this tour.]
- [The output should be formatted as a list of city indices representing the tour, starting and ending at city 0, and should include the total travel cost of the tour.]
