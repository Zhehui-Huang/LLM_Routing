- [The robot must start and end its tour at the depot city 0.]
- [The robot should visit exactly 16 of the available 20 cities.]
- [Travel cost between cities is calculated using the Euclidean distance.]
- [The goal is to find the shortest possible tour that meets the above requirements.]
- [Output the tour as a list of city indices, starting and ending at city 0.]
- [Output the total travel cost of the tour.]
- [The solution should use heuristic approaches suitable for the k-TSP variant.]
