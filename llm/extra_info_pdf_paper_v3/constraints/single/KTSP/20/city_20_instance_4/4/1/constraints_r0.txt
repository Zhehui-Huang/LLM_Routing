- [The problem involves 20 cities with specified coordinates.]
- [There is one robot that starts and ends its journey at the depot city, which is city 0.]
- [The task is to find a tour starting and ending at the depot city 0, visiting exactly 16 cities out of the 20.]
- [The travel cost between any two cities is calculated as the Euclidean distance.]
- [The objective is to determine the shortest possible tour for the 16-city visit constraint.]
- [The output should include a list of the city indices in the order visited starting and ending at city 0, and the total travel cost of the tour.]
