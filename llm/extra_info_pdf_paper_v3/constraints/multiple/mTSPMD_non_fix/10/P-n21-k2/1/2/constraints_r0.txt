- [Requirement 1] Each robot must start its journey from a designated depot city (Robot 0 from Depot City 0 and Robot 1 from Depot City 1).
- [Requirement 2] Robots must collectively visit all cities exactly once.
- [Requirement 3] Each tour should end at any city and does not have to return to its starting depot.
- [Requirement 4] The goal is to minimize the total travel cost across all robots combined while ensuring optimized tours.
- [Requirement 5] The output should consist of each robot's tour path starting and ending at its designated depot, total travel cost for each robotâ€™s tour, and the total combined cost for all tours.
- [Requirement 6] Travel cost is calculated as the Euclidean distance between two cities.
