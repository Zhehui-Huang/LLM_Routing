- [Requirement 1] The robots must collectively visit all cities exactly once, with each robot starting from the designated depot (city 0 for robot 0 and city 1 for robot 1).
- [Requirement 2] Each robot can end its tour at any city; it does not need to return to its starting depot.
- [Requirement 3] The solution should minimize the total travel cost for all robots combined, with the travel cost calculated as the Euclidean distance between any two cities.
