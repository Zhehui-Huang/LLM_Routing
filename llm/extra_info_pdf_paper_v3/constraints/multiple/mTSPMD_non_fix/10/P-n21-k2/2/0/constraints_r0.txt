- [There are 21 cities including two depots (city 0 and city 1).]
- [Each robot starts its journey from depot city 0.]
- [Robots can travel between any two cities, with the travel cost being the Euclidean distance between those cities.]
- [The goal is to collectively visit all cities exactly once, optimizing for the lowest total travel cost.]
- [Each robot can end its tour at any city, not necessarily returning to its start depot.]
- [Robots do not need to visit the same number of cities.]
- [The output should list the tour for each robot starting and ending at its assigned depot, include the travel cost for each tour, and the combined total travel cost for all robots.]
