- [There are 21 numbered cities with specific coordinates listed.]
- [There are 2 robots starting from depot city 0.]
- [Robots can travel between any two cities.]
- [Travel cost is calculated as the Euclidean distance between two cities.]
- [Each robot starts at depot city 0 but does not need to return to the depot after completing its tour.]
- [Each city must be visited exactly once by any robot.]
- [Minimize the total travel distance or cost collectively for both robots.]
- [Output the routes for each robot and the total travel cost for each tour, as well as the overall total travel cost, maintaining specified format requirements.]
