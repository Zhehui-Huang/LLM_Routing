- [Requirement 1] Each robot must start its tour from Depot City 0.
- [Requirement 2] All 21 cities must be visited exactly once across the two robots.
- [Requirement 3] Each robot can end its tour at any city (does not have to be a depot).
- [Requirement 4] Objective is to minimize the combined travel cost for all robots.
- [Requirement 5] Calculate the travel cost using Euclidean distance between cities.
- [Requirement 6] Output should include the tour for each robot starting and ending at its assigned depot, individual travel costs for each robot, and the overall total travel cost.
