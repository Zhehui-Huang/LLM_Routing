- [Requirement 1] There are 22 cities including multiple depots, and 4 robots. Each robot starts its tour at Depot city 0 and does not need to return to the depot after completing its tour.
- [Requirement 2] Each robot must visit all cities exactly once collectively among all robots, and they can end at any city.
- [Requirement 3] The objective is to minimize the total travel cost for all robots combined, where the travel cost is calculated as the Euclidean distance between two cities.
- [Requirement 4] Output should list the tours for each robot starting and ending at its assigned depot, the total travel cost for each tour, and the overall total travel cost.
