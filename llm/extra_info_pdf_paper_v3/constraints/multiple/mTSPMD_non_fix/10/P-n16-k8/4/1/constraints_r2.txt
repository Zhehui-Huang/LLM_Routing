- [Requirement 1] Each robot must start from depot city 0.
- [Requirement 2] All cities must be visited exactly once by the robots.
- [Requirement 3] Robots can stop at any city as their endpoint; they do not need to return to the starting depot.
- [Requirement 4] The solution must minimize the total travel cost for all robots combined.
- [Requirement 5] Travel cost between cities is calculated as the Euclidean distance.
- [Requirement 6] The output should include the tour for each robot starting and ending at its assigned depot, the individual travel cost for each robot's tour, and the overall total travel cost.
