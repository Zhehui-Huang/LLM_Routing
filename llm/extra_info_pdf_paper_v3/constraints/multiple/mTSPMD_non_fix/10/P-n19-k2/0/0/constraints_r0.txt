- [There are 19 cities, each associated with specific coordinates.]
- [There are 2 robots. Robot IDs start from 0.]
- [All robots start at depot city 0.]
- [Travel between any two cities is possible.]
- [Travel cost is calculated as the Euclidean distance between two cities.]
- [Robots must collectively visit all cities exactly once.]
- [Each robot starts at the designated depot (depot city 0 for both robots in this scenario).]
- [Robots do not need to return to the depot after completing their tour.]
- [The endpoint of each tour can be any city.]
- [The objective is to determine the shortest tours for each robot while minimizing the total travel cost for all robots combined.]
