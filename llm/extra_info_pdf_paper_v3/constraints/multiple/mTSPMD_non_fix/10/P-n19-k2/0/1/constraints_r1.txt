- [There are 19 cities with specified coordinates.]
- [There are 2 robots starting from depot city 0.]
- [Robots can travel between any two cities.]
- [Travel cost is calculated as the Euclidean distance between two cities.]
- [Each robot needs to start its tour from depot city 0 and does not need to return after completing its tour.]
- [Each city must be visited exactly once by any robot.]
- [The overall goal is to minimize the total travel cost for all robots combined.]
- [Output the tours for each robot as a list of city indices, starting and ending at its assigned depot.]
- [Output the total travel cost for each tour and the overall total travel cost.]
- [Endpoints for the robots' tours are flexible; they can stop at any city.]
