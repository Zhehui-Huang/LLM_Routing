- [There are 19 specific cities with fixed coordinates, including two depots (city indices 0 and 1).]
- [Two robots are available for the routing task.]
- [Both robots start their routes from a common depot (depot city 0).]
- [Robots do not need to return to any depot after completing their tours.]
- [Travel costs are calculated using Euclidean distances between cities.]
- [Each city, other than depots, must be visited exactly once by any one of the robots.]
- [The objective is to minimize the total travel cost across all robot tours combined.]
- [Output should list each robot's tour as a sequence of visited city indices, starting and potentially not ending at their assigned depot.]
- [Output should also include the total travel cost for each robot's tour and the combined total cost for all tours.]
