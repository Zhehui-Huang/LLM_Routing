- [There are 19 cities with specified coordinates, including two depot cities labeled as 0 and 1.]
- [There are two robots, both starting from depot city 0.]
- [Each robot must visit all cities exactly once collectively between them.]
- [Each robot starts from a designated depot (only depot 0 in this scenario) and can stop at any city.]
- [Robots do not need to return to the depot after completing their tour.]
- [The travel cost is calculated as the Euclidean distance between two cities.]
- [The objective is to minimize the total travel cost for all robots combined while adhering to the routing constraints.]
- [Output the tours for each robot as a list of city indices, beginning and potentially ending at its assigned depot.]
- [Provide the total travel cost for each tour and the overall total travel cost.]
