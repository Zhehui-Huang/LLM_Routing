- [Requirement 3] Robots can stop at any city as their endpoint.
- [Requirement 4] Each robot's tour must visit each city exactly once amongst all robots, collectively.
- [Requirement 5] Calculate travel cost as the Euclidean distance between two cities.
- [Requirement 6] The objective is to minimize the total travel cost for all robots combined.
- [Requirement 7] Each robot's tour should start from Depot city 0 and has no fixed endpoint requirement.
- [Requirement 8] Output the tours for each robot as a list of city indices that starts and ends at the assigned depot.
- [Requirement 9] Output the total travel cost for each robot's tour as well as the overall total travel cost.
- [Requirement 10] Tours should be optimized for the lowest total travel distance.
- [Requirement 11] Format the output with details of each robot's tour, individual tour cost, and the overall travel cost.
