- [There are 23 cities, each defined by unique coordinates, including 7 depot cities.]
- [There are 8 robots available, all starting at the same depot city 0.]
- [Each robot can travel between any two cities.]
- [Travel cost is based on the Euclidean distance between two cities.]
- [All cities must be visited exactly once by the robots combined.]
- [Robots do not need to return to the depot city after their final city visit.]
- [The objective is to minimize the total combined travel cost of all robots.]
- [Each tour for a robot starts and ends at designated depots.]
- [The output should list the tours for each robot starting and ending at designated depots, and specify both individual and total travel costs.]
