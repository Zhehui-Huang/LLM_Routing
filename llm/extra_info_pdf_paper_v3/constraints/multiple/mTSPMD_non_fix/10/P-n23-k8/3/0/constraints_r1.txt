- [There are 23 cities, each with a unique coordinate.]
- [There are 8 robots, all starting from depot city 0.]
- [Travel cost between two cities is calculated using the Euclidean distance.]
- [All robots must collectively visit all cities exactly once.]
- [Each robot starts from a depot and does not need to return to any depot after completing its tour.]
- [The aim is to minimize the total travel cost for all robots combined while ensuring each city is visited exactly once and optimizing the shortest tours for each robot.]
- [Output the tours for each robot as a list of city indices, starting and ending at its assigned depot, with total travel cost for each tour and the overall total cost.]
