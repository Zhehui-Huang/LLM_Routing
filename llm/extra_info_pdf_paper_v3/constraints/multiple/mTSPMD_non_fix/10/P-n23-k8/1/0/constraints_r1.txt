- [There are 23 cities with specified coordinates.]
- [There are 8 robots, all starting from depot city 0.]
- [Robots can travel between any two cities.]
- [Travel cost is calculated as the Euclidean distance between two cities.]
- [Robots need to collectively visit all cities exactly once.]
- [Each robot starts from a designated depot and does not need to return to the depot after completing its tour.]
- [The goal is to minimize the total travel cost for all robots combined.]
- [Output the tours for each robot as a list of city indices.]
- [Output the total travel cost for each tour and the overall total travel cost.]
