- [Requirement 1] All robots must start their tour from the same depot city (city 0).
- [Requirement 2] Each robot travels between cities, and the travel cost is determined by the Euclidean distance between cities.
- [Requirement 3] Each city, except the starting depot (city 0), must be visited exactly once by any robot.
- [Requirement 4] The tours for each robot can end at any city, not necessarily a depot or the starting point.
- [Requirement 5] The objective is to minimize the total travel cost for all robots combined while ensuring each city is visited exactly once.
- [Requirement 6] Output the tour route for each robot as a list of city indices, starting and ending at the designated depot for each with the exact total travel cost for each robot and the overall total travel cost.
- [Requirement 7] No two robots can visit the same city, excluding the starting depot city.
