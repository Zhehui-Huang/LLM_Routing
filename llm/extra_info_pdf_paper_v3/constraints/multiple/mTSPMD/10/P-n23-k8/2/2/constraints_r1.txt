- [Requirement 1] Each robot must visit all cities exactly once, including its starting (depot) city, before returning to the same depot city.
- [Requirement 2] The travel cost between cities is calculated using the Euclidean distance formula.
- [Requirement 3] The objective is to minimize the combined total travel cost for all robot tours.
- [Requirement 4] Output the tour for each robot starting and ending at its assigned depot, the travel cost of each robot's tour, and the overall total travel cost.
- [Requirement 5] Ensure that every city is assigned to exactly one robot's tour.
