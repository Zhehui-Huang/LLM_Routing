- [Requirement 1] The robots must collectively visit all cities exactly once and then return to their respective depots.
- [Requirement 2] Each robot starts and ends at its assigned depot: Robot 0 at depot city 0, and Robot 1 at depot city 1.
- [Requirement 3] The objective is to determine the shortest possible tours for each robot while minimizing the total travel cost for all robots combined.
- [Requirement 4] Travel cost between any two cities is calculated as the Euclidean distance.
- [Requirement 5] Output the tours for each robot as a list of city indices, starting and ending at their respective depots.
- [Requirement 6] Output the individual total travel cost for each robot and the combined total travel cost for both robots.
