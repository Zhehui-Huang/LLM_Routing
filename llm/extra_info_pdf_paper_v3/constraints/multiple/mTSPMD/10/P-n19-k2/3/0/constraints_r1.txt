- [There are 19 cities including two depot cities.]
- [City coordinates are given, including the depots.]
- [There are 2 robots, each with distinct starting and ending depots (Robot 0 starts and ends at city 0, Robot 1 starts and ends at city 1).]
- [Robots can travel between any two cities.]
- [Travel cost between cities is calculated as the Euclidean distance.]
- [Each robot must visit each city exactly once except their depot city which must be visited twice (start and end).]
- [Objective is to minimize the total travel cost for all robots combined.]
- [Tour results should detail the path for each robot and include the start and end at their respective depots.]
- [Output should specify the tour for each robot, total travel cost for each tour, and the overall total travel cost.]
