- [There are 21 cities with specified coordinates, including 2 depots.]
- [There are 2 robots, each starting and ending at a different specified depot.]
- [Robots must collectively visit all cities exactly once and then return to their respective depots.]
- [The objective is to determine the shortest possible tours for each robot while minimizing the total travel cost for all robots combined.]
- [Travel cost is calculated as the Euclidean distance between two cities.]
- [Output must include the tour for each robot as a list of city indices, starting and ending at its assigned depot.]
- [Output must include the total travel cost for each tour and the overall total travel cost.]
