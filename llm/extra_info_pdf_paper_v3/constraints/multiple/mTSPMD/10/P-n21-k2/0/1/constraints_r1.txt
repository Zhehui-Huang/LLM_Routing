- [Requirement 1] Each robot starts and ends its tour at its assigned depot city.
- [Requirement 2] Every city except depot cities must be visited exactly once by any robot.
- [Requirement 3] The objective is to minimize the total travel cost for all robots combined. Total travel cost is the sum of the individual costs for each robot's tour.
- [Requirement 4] The number of robots is 2, and robots can travel between any two cities.
- [Requirement 5] Travel cost is defined as the Euclidean distance between two cities.
- [Requirement 6] Output the tours for each robot as a list of city indices starting and ending at the assigned depot.
- [Requirement 7] Output the travel cost for each individual robot's tour and the overall combined cost.
