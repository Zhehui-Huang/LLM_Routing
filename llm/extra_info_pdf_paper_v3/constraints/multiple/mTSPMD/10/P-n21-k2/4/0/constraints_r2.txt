- [Requirement 1] Two robots must be utilized, with each starting and ending at their assigned depot: Robot 0 at depot city 0 and Robot 1 at depot city 1.
- [Requirement 2] The robots must collectively visit all cities exactly once, ensuring that no city is visited more than once across all tours combined.
- [Requirement 3] The goal is to determine the shortest possible tours for each robot while minimizing the total combined travel cost for all robots.
- [Requirement 4] The travel cost is calculated using the Euclidean distance between two cities.
- [Requirement 5] Each city must be included in a tour exactly once, except the depot cities which are start and end points for their respective tours.
- [Requirement 6] Compute and provide the travel cost for each individual tour and the overall total travel cost for all tours combined.
- [Requirement 7] The solution must be presented such that each tour starts and ends at the respective robot's starting depot.
- [Requirement 8] Output format: list city indices for each robot's tour beginning and ending at the respective depot, the total travel cost for each robot, and the overall travel cost for all tours.
