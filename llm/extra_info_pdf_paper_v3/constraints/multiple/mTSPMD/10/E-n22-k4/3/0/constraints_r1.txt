- [Requirement 1] Each robot must visit every city exactly once and then return to their respective depots.
- [Requirement 2] The robots must start and end their tour at the assigned depot city (Robot 0 at Depot 0, Robot 1 at Depot 1, Robot 2 at Depot 2, Robot 3 at Depot 3).
- [Requirement 3] The objective is to determine the shortest possible tours for each robot while minimizing the total travel cost for all robots combined.
- [Requirement 4] The travel cost between two cities is calculated using the Euclidean distance formula.
- [Requirement 5] Output each robot's tour as a list of city indices, indicating a complete loop starting and ending at the assigned depot.
- [Requirement 6] Output the total travel cost for each robot's tour and the combined total travel cost for all tours.
