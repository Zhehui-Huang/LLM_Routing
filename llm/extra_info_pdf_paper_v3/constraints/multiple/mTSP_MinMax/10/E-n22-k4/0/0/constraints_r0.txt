- [Requirement 1]: There are 22 cities, each defined by unique coordinates, including a depot city (city 0).
- [Requirement 2]: There are 4 robots. Each robot starts and ends its tour at the depot city.
- [Requirement 3]: The robots must collectively visit all cities exactly once, excluding the depot city as a destination, before returning to the depot city.
- [Requirement 4]: The travel cost between two cities is calculated as the Euclidean distance.
- [Requirement 5]: The objective is to minimize the maximum distance traveled by any single robot.
- [Requirement 6]: Output for each robot includes the tour as a list of city indices starting and ending at city 0, the individual travel cost for each tour, and the maximum travel cost among all tours.
- [Requirement 7]: Apply the ITSHA heuristic for the solution approach, using an initialization stage with fuzzy c-means clustering and random greedy methods, followed by an improvement stage employing Variable Neighborhood Search with custom local search neighborhoods.
