- [All robots start and end tours at the depot city.]
- [Robots must visit each city exactly once, excluding the depot city.]
- [The objective is to minimize the maximum distance traveled by any single robot.]
- [Distance is calculated using Euclidean distance between cities.]
- [Tours and costs for each robot should be output, specifying paths and distances.]
- [The output should include the maximum travel cost among all tours.]
