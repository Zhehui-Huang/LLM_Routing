- [Requirement 1]: Robots must collectively visit all cities exactly once, excluding the depot city as a destination, and then return to the depot city after completing their tours.
- [Requirement 2]: Each robot starts and ends its tour at the depot.
- [Requirement 3]: The primary objective is to minimize the maximum distance traveled by any single robot.
- [Requirement 4]: The travel cost is calculated as the Euclidean distance between two cities.
- [Requirement 5]: The optimization methods should be based on the initialization stage with fuzzy c-means clustering and random greedy heuristics for generating initial solutions, and an improvement stage applying Variable Neighborhood Search (VNS) to refine these solutions.
- [Requirement 6]: The output must include the tours for each robot, the total distance of each tour, and the maximum distance traveled among all tours, formatted as specified.
