- [There are 16 cities including a depot city.]
- [All robots start and end their tours at the depot city.]
- [Each robot can travel between any two cities.]
- [Robots must visit each city exactly once, excluding the depot city.]
- [Travel cost between cities is calculated as the Euclidean distance.]
- [Objective is to minimize the maximum distance traveled by any single robot.]
- [Output the tours and costs for each robot starting and ending at the depot.]
- [Output the maximum travel cost among all tours.]
