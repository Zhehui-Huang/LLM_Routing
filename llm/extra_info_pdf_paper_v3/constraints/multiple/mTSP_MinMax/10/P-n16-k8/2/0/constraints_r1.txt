- [Requirement 3] Each city, except the depot, must be visited exactly once by the robots collectively.
- [Requirement 4] Minimize the maximum distance traveled by any single robot.
- [Requirement 5] Calculate travel costs between cities using Euclidean distance.
- [Requirement 6] Output the tours for each robot as a list of city indices, each starting and ending at the depot city.
- [Requirement 7] Output the total travel cost for each tour and determine the maximum travel cost among all tours.
