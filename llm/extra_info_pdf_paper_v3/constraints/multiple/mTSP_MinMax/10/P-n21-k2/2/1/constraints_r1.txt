- [There are 21 cities, including a depot city labeled as city 0.]
- [Each robot starts and ends its tour at the depot city 0.]
- [The robots must collectively visit all cities exactly once, excluding the depot city as a destination.]
- [The primary objective is to minimize the maximum distance traveled by any single robot.]
- [Travel cost is calculated as the Euclidean distance between two cities.]
- [Number of robots available is 2.]
- [Output should include the tours for each robot, starting and ending at the depot city 0.]
- [Output should include the travel cost for each tour and the maximum travel cost among all tours.]
