- [Requirement 1] There are 19 cities, including a depot city (city 0). All robots start and end their tours at the depot city.
- [Requirement 2] The robots must collectively visit each city exactly once, excluding the depot city, and then return to the depot city.
- [Requirement 3] The objective is to determine the shortest possible tours for the robots to minimize the total travel cost, measured by the Euclidean distance between the cities.
