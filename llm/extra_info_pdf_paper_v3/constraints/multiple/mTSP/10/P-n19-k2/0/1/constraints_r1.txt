- [There are 19 cities including a depot city, and their coordinates are given.]
- [There are 2 robots, both starting and ending their tours at the depot city.]
- [Robots can travel between any two cities.]
- [Travel cost is calculated as the Euclidean distance between two cities.]
- [The objective is to determine the shortest possible tours for the robots while minimizing the total travel cost.]
- [Each city, except for the depot, must be visited exactly once by the robots collectively.]
- [Each robot's tour must start and end at the depot city 0.]
- [Output should list tours and total travel costs for each robot and the overall total travel cost.]
