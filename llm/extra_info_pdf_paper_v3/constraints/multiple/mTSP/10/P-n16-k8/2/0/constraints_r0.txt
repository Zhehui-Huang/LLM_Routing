- [Requirement 1]: There are 16 cities with specified coordinates, and each city must be visited exactly once by the robots, except for the depot city, which is both the start and end point for all routes.
- [Requirement 2]: There are 8 robots, all starting and ending their tours at the depot city.
- [Requirement 3]: The objective is to minimize the total travel cost across all robot tours, calculated using the Euclidean distance between cities. Each city (except the depot) must be incorporated into the tours such that each city is visited exactly once across all robot routes.
