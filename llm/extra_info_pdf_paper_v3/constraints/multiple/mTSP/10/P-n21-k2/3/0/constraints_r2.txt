- [Requirement 1] There are 21 cities with specified coordinates, including a depot city (City 0).
- [Requirement 2] There are 2 robots, both starting and ending their tours at the depot.
- [Requirement 3] Robots can travel between any two cities.
- [Requirement 4] Travel cost is calculated as the Euclidean distance between two cities.
- [Requirement 5] Each city, except the depot, must be visited exactly once by the robots collectively.
- [Requirement 6] The objective is to determine the shortest possible tours for the robots while minimizing the total travel cost.
- [Requirement 7] Output the tours for each robot as a list of city indices starting and ending at City 0.
- [Requirement 8] Output the total travel cost for each tour and the overall total travel cost.
- [Requirement 9] Employ a generalized k-Opt exchange procedure to optimize the routes.
