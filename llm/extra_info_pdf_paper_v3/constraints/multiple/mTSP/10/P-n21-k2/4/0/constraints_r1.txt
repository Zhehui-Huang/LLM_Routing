- [There are 21 cities, including the depot city.]
- [Robots must start and end at the depot city.]
- [Each robot's tour should visit each city exactly once, excluding the depot city as a destination.]
- [Travel cost is based on the Euclidean distance between two cities.]
- [The objective is to determine the shortest possible tours for the robots while minimizing the total travel cost.]
- [There are 2 robots available for the task.]
- [The output should include the tour for each robot and the total travel cost for each tour, as well as the overall total travel cost.]
