- [There are 21 cities including the depot city, and their coordinates are specified.]
- [There are 2 robots, and both start at the depot city.]
- [Robots must visit all cities exactly once, excluding the depot as a destination, and then return to the depot.]
- [The objective is to determine the shortest possible tours for the robots while minimizing the total travel cost.]
- [Travel cost is calculated as the Euclidean distance between two cities.]
- [Every city, except the depot, must be visited exactly once by the robots.]
- [Each robot's tour should start and end at the depot city.]
- [Output should list the tours for each robot and the total travel costs per tour, along with the overall total travel cost.]
