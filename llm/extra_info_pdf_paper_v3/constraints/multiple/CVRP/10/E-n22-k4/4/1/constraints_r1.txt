- [There are 22 cities, including the depot city (City 0).]
- [Each city has a specified demand, ranging from 0 for the depot city to 2500 for City 19.]
- [There are 4 robots available for the task.]
- [Each robot has a carrying capacity of 6000.]
- [All robots start their route at depot city 0.]
- [Travel between any two cities is possible, with costs calculated based on the Euclidean distance between the cities.]
- [Each robot must complete its route by returning to the depot city 0.]
- [The objective is to fulfill the demand of each city, excluding the depot city, without exceeding the capacity constraints of each robot.]
- [The task is to minimize the total travel cost for all robot tours, calculated collectively.]
