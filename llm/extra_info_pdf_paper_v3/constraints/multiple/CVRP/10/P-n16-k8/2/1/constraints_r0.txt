- [There are 16 cities including a Depot city indexed as 0.]
- [Each city has a set coordinate in a 2-dimensional plane, and the demand that must be met except for the depot which has zero demand.]
- [8 robots are available, each starting at the depot city 0, all with a travel capacity of 35 units.]
- [Travel cost between any two cities is determined by their Euclidean distance.]
- [Robots' tours should start and end at the depot city 0.]
- [City demands must be fully met by the deliveries from the robots.]
- [The carrying capacity of the robots, 35 units, must not be exceeded when delivering to cities.]
- [Objective is to determine the shortest possible tours for the robots, minimizing the total travel cost while fulfilling the demand and capacity constraints.]
- [Output requires each robot's tour path, individual total travel cost per tour, and the overall total travel cost.]
