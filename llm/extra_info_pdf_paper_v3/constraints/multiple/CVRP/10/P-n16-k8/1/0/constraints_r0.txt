- [There are 16 cities, each with specific coordinates.]
- [There is a depot city (City 0) with coordinates (30, 40).]
- [Each city has a specified demand for goods ranging from 0 to 31.]
- [There are 8 robots available for delivery tasks.]
- [Each robot has a capacity of 35 units.]
- [All robots start from the depot city.]
- [Robots can travel between any two cities.]
- [Travel cost is calculated using the Euclidean distance between cities.]
- [Robots must deliver goods to all cities (excluding the depot) and return back to the depot city after their deliveries.]
- [The demand of each city must be fully met without exceeding the carrying capacity of any robot.]
- [The goal is to minimize the total travel cost for all robot tours.]
- [Each robot's route must start at the depot city and end at the depot city.]
