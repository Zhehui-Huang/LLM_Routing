- [There are 16 cities including the depot city, with specified coordinates for each.]
- [Each city except the depot city has a specified demand that must be met.]
- [There are 8 robots, each having a capacity of 35.]
- [All robots start their tours at the depot city 0.]
- [Each robot can travel between any two cities, and the travel cost is the Euclidean distance between these cities.]
- [The objective is to deliver goods to each city, satisfying the demands without exceeding the robots' capacity, and return to the depot city.]
- [The goal is to minimize the total travel cost for all tours while ensuring each tour starts and ends at the depot city.]
- [Each robot's tour sequence and capacity must be optimally managed considering both route sequence and vehicle capacity.]
- [The solution should avoid repetitive routes and ensure a diverse exploration of possible route combinations.]
