- [There are 16 cities, including a depot city labelled as city 0.]
- [The position coordinates for each city are provided.]
- [Each city has a specific demand for goods, except for the depot city which has a demand of 0.]
- [There are 8 robots available for making the deliveries.]
- [Each robot has a carrying capacity of 35 units.]
- [All robots start at the depot city 0.]
- [Robots can travel between any two cities.]
- [The travel cost is calculated using the Euclidean distance between two cities.]
- [The goal is to ensure that the demand of each city is met without exceeding each robot's capacity.]
- [Each robot must return to the depot city after completing their deliveries.]
- [The objective is to minimize the total travel cost for all tours.]
