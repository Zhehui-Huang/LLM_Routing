- [There are 19 cities including the depot city, each with specified coordinates.]
- [Each city except the depot has a specific demand that must be met.]
- [There are 2 robots with a carrying capacity of 160 each.]
- [All robots start their journey from the depot city.]
- [The travel cost between two cities is calculated based on the Euclidean distance.]
- [Robots must deliver goods to all cities, meet the demands fully, and return to the depot city after deliveries.]
- [The capacity constraint of each robot must not be exceeded.]
- [The objective is to minimize the total travel cost for all tours.]
