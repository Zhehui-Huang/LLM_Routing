- [Cities and coordinates are provided with the depot city being city 0.]
- [There are 19 cities to be covered by the robots.]
- [Each city has a specific demand that must be fully met by the robot deliveries.]
- [Robots must start and end their tours at the depot city 0.]
- [Number of robots available for the task is 2.]
- [Each robot has a carrying capacity of 160 units.]
- [Travel cost between any two cities is determined by the Euclidean distance.]
- [Objective is to minimize the total travel cost for all the robot tours.]
- [Demand of each city excluding the depot must be met without exceeding the robot's capacity constraints.]
