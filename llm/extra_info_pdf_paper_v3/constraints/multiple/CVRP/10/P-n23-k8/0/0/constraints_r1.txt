- [Each robot must start and end its tour at the depot city (City 0).]
- [The travel cost between cities is calculated using the Euclidean distance.]
- [The robots must collectively deliver goods to all cities, excluding the depot city.]
- [The demand of each city, excluding the depot, must be fully met from the supplies carried by the robots.]
- [The carrying capacity of each robot is limited to 40 units.]
- [The tours should be planned to minimize the sum of the distances (total travel cost) traveled by all robots.]
- [The capacity constraints of the robots must not be exceeded.]
- [There are 8 robots available for making deliveries.]
