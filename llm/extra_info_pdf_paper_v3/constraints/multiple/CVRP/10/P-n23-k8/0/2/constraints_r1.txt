- [Each robot starts and ends its tour at the depot city (City 0).]
- [Each city's demand must be fully met by the robots delivering the goods.]
- [The carrying capacity of each robot (40 units) must not be exceeded during each tour.]
- [The travel cost between cities is calculated using the Euclidean distance.]
- [The objective is to minimize the total travel cost for all tours combined.]
