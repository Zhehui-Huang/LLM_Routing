- [Requirement 1] There are 23 cities including a depot city (city 0) with specified coordinates for each.
- [Requirement 2] Each city (excluding the depot) has a specific demand that must be fully met.
- [Requirement 3] There are 8 robots, each with a capacity limit of 40 units.
- [Requirement 4] All robots start and end their tours at the depot city.
- [Requirement 5] Tours must not exceed the carrying capacity of any robot.
- [Requirement 6] Travel cost between cities is calculated using the Euclidean distance.
- [Requirement 7] The objective is to minimize the total travel cost for all tours.
- [Requirement 8] Output must include the tour for each robot, the total travel cost for each robot's tour, and the overall total travel cost.
- [Requirement 9] Each robot's tour must begin and end at the depot city.
- [Requirement 10] Ensure no city's demand is split between multiple robots; each city's demand should be met in a single tour by a single robot.
