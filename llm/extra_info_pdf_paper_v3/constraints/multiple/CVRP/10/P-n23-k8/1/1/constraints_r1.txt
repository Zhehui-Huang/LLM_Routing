- [There are 23 cities, including the depot city (city 0).]
- [Each city has a specific pair of coordinates.]
- [Each city (excluding the depot city) has a specific demand that must be met.]
- [There are 8 robots, each with an ID starting from 0.]
- [Each robot has a capacity of 40.]
- [All robots start at the depot city 0.]
- [Robots can travel between any two cities.]
- [Travel cost is calculated as the Euclidean distance between two cities.]
- [The robots must collectively deliver goods to all cities, excluding the depot city, and then return to the depot city after completing their deliveries.]
- [The capacity constraints of the robots must not be exceeded.]
- [The objective is to determine the shortest possible tours for the robots to minimize the total travel cost for all tours.]
- [Each robot tour output should list city indices, starting and ending at the depot city 0.]
- [Output should include the total travel cost for each tour and the overall total travel cost.]
