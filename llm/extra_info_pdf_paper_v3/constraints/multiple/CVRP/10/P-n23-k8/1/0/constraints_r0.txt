- [There are 23 cities including a depot city (city 0).]
- [Each city, excluding the depot, has a specific demand that must be met.]
- [There are 8 robots with a carrying capacity of 40 each.]
- [All robots start at the depot city 0.]
- [The travel cost between two cities is calculated using the Euclidean distance.]
- [Robots must deliver goods to all cities and return to the depot city after completing their deliveries.]
- [The objective is to minimize the total travel cost for all tours.]
- [Each robot's tour must start and end at the depot city 0.]
- [The capacity constraints of the robots must not be exceeded.]
- [Each tour must be listed in terms of city indices and should include the total travel cost for that tour along with the overall total travel cost.]
