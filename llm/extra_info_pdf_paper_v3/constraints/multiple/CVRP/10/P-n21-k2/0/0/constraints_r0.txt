- [There are 21 cities, including a depot city (city 0).]
- [Each city has specific coordinates and demands, except the depot city which has a demand of 0.]
- [There are 2 robots, each starting at the depot city (city 0).]
- [Each robot has a carrying capacity of 160.]
- [Travel cost is calculated as the Euclidean distance between two cities.]
- [Robots must deliver goods to all cities (excluding depot), meeting city demands without exceeding robot capacity limits.]
- [Upon completing the deliveries, robots must return to the depot city.]
- [Objective: Minimize the total travel cost for all robot tours.]
- [Each robot tour must start and end at the city depot (city 0).]
- [Output should include detailed tours and travel costs for each robot, plus an overall total travel cost.]
