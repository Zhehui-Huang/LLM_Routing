- [Each robot starts and ends its tour at the depot city 0.]

- [The combined capacity of all deliveries made by a robot on a tour must not exceed the robot's capacity of 160.]
- [The objective is to minimize the total travel cost for all tours combined.]
- [Travel cost is calculated based on the Euclidean distance between cities.]
