- [There are 21 cities with specified coordinates, starting with the depot city indexed at 0.]
- [Each city has a specific demand that must be met by the robots.]
- [There are 2 robots with a capacity of 160 units each.]
- [All robots start their route at the depot city 0.]
- [The objective is to minimize the total travel distance for all robots.]
- [The robots must plan their tours such that they start and end at the depot city.]
- [The travel cost between any two cities is calculated using the Euclidean distance.]
- [Each robot's tour must not exceed its capacity constraint of 160 units.]
- [The entire demand of each city, excluding the depot, must be fulfilled by the robots collectively.]
