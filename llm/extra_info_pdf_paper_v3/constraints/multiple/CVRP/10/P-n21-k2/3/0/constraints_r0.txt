- [There are 21 cities, including the depot city. Each city is identified by a unique index (0 through 20).]
- [Coordinates for each city are provided, with City 0 being the depot where all travel starts and ends.]
- [Each city has a specific demand (except for the depot, City 0, which has a demand of 0).]
- [There are 2 robots available for making deliveries. Both start from the depot city.]
- [Each robot has a carrying capacity of 160 units.]
- [The objective is to minimize the total travel cost, measured as the Euclidean distance between cities.]
- [Each robot's tour must start and end at the depot city (City 0).]
- [The delivered goods must meet or exceed the city-specific demand without exceeding the robot's capacity.]
- [The tours must be designed to ensure that the capacity constraints of each robot are not violated.]
- [Each city must be visited by the robots exactly once, excluding the depot which must be the start and end point for each tour.]
