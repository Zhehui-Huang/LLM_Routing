- [There are 22 cities, including the depot city.]
- [Each robot must start and end its tour at the depot city.]
- [Robots must visit all cities exactly once, excluding the depot city as a destination.]
- [The objective is to determine the shortest possible tours for the robots while minimizing the total travel cost.]
- [The travel cost between any two cities is calculated as the Euclidean distance.]
- [The number of robots available is 4.]
- [Each tour and the corresponding travel costs for each robot need to be outputted.]
- [The overall total travel cost also needs to be outputted.]
- [All output tours must start and end at the depot city.]
