- [There are 19 cities including the depot.]
- [Cities are identified by indices and have specific coordinates.]
- [There are 2 robots starting their routes at the depot city.]
- [Robots must visit all cities exactly once, excluding the depot city which is only a start and end point.]
- [Travel cost is calculated using the Euclidean distance between cities.]
- [The goal is to minimize the total travel cost for all robots combined.]
- [Each robot's tour starts and ends at the depot city.]
- [Output must include tours for each robot, individual tour costs, and the overall travel cost.]
