- [There are 19 cities including a depot.]
- [Depot city has an index of 0.]
- [Coordinates are provided for each city.]
- [Two robots are available to complete the task.]
- [All robots start and end their routes at the depot city.]
- [Each robot must visit every city exactly once, excluding the depot city, and then return to the depot.]
- [Objective is to minimize the total distance traveled collectively by the robots.]
- [Total travel cost is calculated as the Euclidean distance between cities.]
- [Output should include the tour for each robot and the total and individual travel costs.]
