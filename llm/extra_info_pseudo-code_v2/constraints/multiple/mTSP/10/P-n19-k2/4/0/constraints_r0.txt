- [There are 19 cities including the depot city.]
- [Depot city is city 0.]
- [Number of robots: 2.]
- [All robots start at depot city 0.]
- [Robots can travel between any two cities.]
- [Travel cost is calculated as the Euclidean distance between two cities.]
- [Each robot must start and end its tour at the depot city 0.]
- [All cities, except the depot, must be visited exactly once across the collective tours of the robots.]
- [Objective is to minimize the total travel cost for all tours combined.]
- [Output the tours for each robot as a list of city indices, starting and ending at city 0.]
- [Output the total travel cost for each tour and the overall total travel cost.]
