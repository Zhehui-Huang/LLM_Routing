- [Requirement 1] There are 19 cities including a depot city. Each city is indexed from 0 (depot) to 18.
- [Requirement 2] There are 2 robots, both starting and ending their tours at the depot city (index 0).
- [Requirement 3] Each robot must collectively visit all cities exactly once, excluding the depot city, and then return to the depot.
- [Requirement 4] Travel cost is calculated as the Euclidean distance between cities.
- [Requirement 5] The objective is to determine the shortest possible tour for each robot while minimizing the total travel cost.
- [Requirement 6] Every city, except the depot, must be visited exactly once collectively by the robots.
- [Requirement 7] Each tour output for the robots must start and end at the depot city.
- [Requirement 8] Output the total travel cost for each tour separately and the overall total travel of both tours combined.
