- [There are 19 cities including the depot city.]
- [Cities are identified with coordinates.]
- [Number of robots is 2, both starting at the depot city (City 0).]
- [All robots must start and end their tours at the depot city.]
- [Travel cost is calculated as the Euclidean distance between two cities.]
- [Each city, except the depot, must be visited exactly once by any robot.]
- [The goal is to minimize the total travel cost for all robots while ensuring each city is visited once.]
- [The robots must collectively visit all cities exactly once, excluding the depot city, and return to the depot city.]
- [Output the tours for each robot as a list of city indices starting and ending at the depot city.]
- [Output the total travel cost for each tour and the overall total travel travel cost.]
