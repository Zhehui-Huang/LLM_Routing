- [There are 16 cities, including the depot city.]
- [All robots start their journey from the depot city, which is city 0.]
- [Each robot must return to the depot city after visiting all assigned cities.]
- [Travel cost is based on the Euclidean distance between two cities.]
- [Every city, except the depot, must be visited exactly once by the robots.]
- [The objective is to minimize the total travel cost for all robots.]
- [The output should specifically format tours and costs for each robot, and include the overall total travel cost.]
- [8 robots are available to perform the tasks.]
