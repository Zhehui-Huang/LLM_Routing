- [There are 16 cities, including the depot city.]
- [All robots start their tour from the depot city 0 and return to it.]
- [Each robot can travel between any two cities.]
- [Travel cost is determined by the Euclidean distance between two cities.]
- [All cities except the depot city must be visited exactly once by the robots collectively.]
- [The objective is to minimize the total travel cost, which includes determining the shortest possible tours for the robots.]
- [The number of robots available is 8.]
- [Each robot's tour should be output as a list of city indices, starting and ending at the depot city 0.]
- [The output should contain each robot's tour and the total travel cost for that tour, along with the overall total travel cost.]
