- [There are 23 cities including the depot.]
- [Each robot must visit all cities exactly once, excluding the depot city, and then return to the depot city.]
- [All robots start and end their tour at the depot city.]
- [The objective is to determine the shortest possible tours for all robots by minimizing the total travel cost.]
- [Travel cost between cities is calculated as the Euclidean distance.]
- [Output should include the tour for each robot as a list of city indices starting and ending at the city 0.]
- [Output should include the total travel cost for each individual tour and the overall total travel cost.]
