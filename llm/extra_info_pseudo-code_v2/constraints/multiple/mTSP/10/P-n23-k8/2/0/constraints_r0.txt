- [Environment has 23 cities including a depot city at coordinates (30, 40).]
- [Each robot starts and ends its tour at the depot city.]
- [Travel cost between two cities is the Euclidean distance.]
- [8 robots are available for completing the tours.]
- [Each city except the depot must be visited exactly once across all tours.]
- [Objective is to determine the shortest possible tours while minimizing the total travel cost.]
- [Output each robot's tour starting and ending at the depot city.]
- [Output the travel cost for each robot's tour and the overall total travel cost.]
