- [Each robot must start and end its tour at the depot city, which is city 0.]
- [Every city, except the depot, is to be visited exactly once by the robots collectively.]
- [The goal is to determine the shortest possible total and individual tours for the robots to minimize the combined travel cost.]
- [Output should list the city indices for each robot's tour starting and ending at depot, and include the individual and total travel costs.]
- [Travel cost is calculated as the Euclidean distance between two cities.]
