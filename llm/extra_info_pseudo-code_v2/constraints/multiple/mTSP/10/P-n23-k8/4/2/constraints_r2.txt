- [There are 23 cities, including the depot city labeled as City 0.]
- [Coordinates are provided for each city, including the depot.]
- [There are 8 robots, all starting at the depot city.]
- [Each robot can travel between any two cities.]
- [Travel cost between cities is calculated as the Euclidean distance.]
- [Robots must visit each city exactly once, excluding the depot city as a destination, and then return to the depot.]
- [The objective is to minimize the total cumulative travel cost for all robots.]
- [Each tour must start and end at the depot city.]
- [Every city, except the depot, is visited exactly once by the robots.]
- [Output the tours for each robot as a list of city indices starting and ending at the depot city.]
- [Output the total travel cost for each tour and the overall total travel cost.]
- [Implementation of MSTOUR algorithm for routing, including initialization, assignment of cities, tour construction, tour improvement, inter-salesmen optimization and termination.]
