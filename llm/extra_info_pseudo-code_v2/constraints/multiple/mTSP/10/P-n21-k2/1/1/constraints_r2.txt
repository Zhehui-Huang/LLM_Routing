- [There are 21 cities including the depot city.]
- [Each of the 20 cities (excluding the depot) must be visited exactly once by the robots.]
- [All robots start and end their tour at the depot city.]
- [There are 2 robots available for the task.]
- [Travel cost is calculated based on the Euclidean distance between cities.]
- [The objective is to minimize the total travel cost for all the robots' tours combined.]
- [Each city can only be assigned to one robot and visited once, excluding the depot city.]
- [The output should list the tours for each robot starting and ending at the depot city.]
- [The output should detail the total travel cost for each robot's tour and the overall total travel cost.]
- [Implementation of the tour planning should consider heuristics like nearest neighbor and apply improvements like 2-opt or 3-opt for optimization.]
