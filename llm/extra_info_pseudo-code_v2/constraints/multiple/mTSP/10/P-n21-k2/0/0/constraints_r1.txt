- [There are 21 cities, including a depot city labeled as city 0.]
- [Each robot starts and ends its tour at the depot city 0.]
- [Robots must collectively visit all cities exactly once, excluding the depot city as a destination.]
- [The goal is to determine the shortest possible tours for the robots while minimizing the total travel cost.]
- [There are 2 robots available for use.]
- [Travel cost is calculated as the Euclidean distance between two cities.]
- [Output the tours for each robot as a list of city indices starting and ending at the depot city.]
- [Output the total travel cost for each tour and the overall total travel consuming all tours combined.]
