- [There are 19 cities with specified coordinates.]
- [There are two depot cities: Depot city 0 at coordinates (30, 40) and Depot city 1 at coordinates (37, 52).]
- [There are two robots: Robot 0 starts and ends at depot city 0, Robot 1 starts and ends at depot city 1.]
- [Robots can travel between any two cities, and each robot starts and ends at its assigned depot.]
- [The objective is to determine the shortest possible tours for each robot while minimizing the overall travel cost for all robots combined, under the constraint that each city is visited exactly once by any robot.]
- [Travel cost is calculated using the Euclidean distance between two cities.]
- [The tours for the robots must be provided in the format: Robot ID Tour: [city indices starting and ending at the depot].]
- [The output must also include the total travel cost for each tour and the combined total travel cost for all tours.]
