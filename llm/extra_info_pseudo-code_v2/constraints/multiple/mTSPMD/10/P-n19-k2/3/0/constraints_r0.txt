- [There are 19 cities including 2 depots]
- [Coordinates for each city are specified]
- [Number of robots: 2, each assigned to a specific starting and ending depot]
- [Robots can travel between any two cities]
- [Travel cost is calculated as the Euclidean distance between two cities]
- [Each robot must visit all cities exactly once, excluding the other robot's depot, and then return to their respective depots]
- [Objective is to minimize the total travel cost for all robots combined]
- [Modified Ant Colony Optimization algorithm is used to generate solutions]
- [Parameters such as antnum, cyclenum, inittrail, alpha, beta, and rho are to be initialized]
- [Each ant constructs a tour by choosing the next city based on a probability transition formula, considering pheromone level and heuristic information]
- [Pheromone trails are updated after each cycle based on evaporation and pheromone addition]
- [The algorithm stops when no improvement in the best solution is detected for a specified number of cycles]
- [Final output should include the tours for each robot beginning and ending at their respective depots, total travel cost for each tour, and the overall combined travel cost]
