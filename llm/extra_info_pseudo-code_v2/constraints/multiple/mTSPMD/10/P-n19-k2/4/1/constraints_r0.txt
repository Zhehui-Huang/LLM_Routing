- [There are 19 cities, including 2 depot cities: Depot city 0 at coordinates (30, 40) and Depot city 1 at coordinates (37, 52).]
- [There are 2 robots: Robot 0 starts and ends at Depot city 0, and Robot 1 starts and ends at Depot city 1.]
- [Robots must visit all cities exactly once and then return to their respective depots.]
- [The objective is to determine the shortest possible tours for each robot while minimizing the total travel cost for all robots combined.]
- [Travel capability allows robots to travel between any two cities.]
- [Travel cost is calculated as the Euclidean distance between two cities.]
- [Algorithm uses an ant colony optimization approach with parameters such as number of ants (antnum), number of cycles without improvement (cyclenum), initial pheromone (inittrail), influence of pheromone trails (alpha), influence of heuristic information (beta), and pheromone evaporation rate (rho).]
- [The algorithm runs in cycles involving solution construction by ants, where ants decide their next city using probability calculations that consider pheromone levels and heuristic information.]
- [Pheromone trails are updated through evaporation and addition based on the paths used by the ants and their corresponding solution quality.]
- [The main cycle of the algorithm repeats until there is no improvement in the best solution for a specified number of cycles (cyclenum).]
- [Output should include the tour for each robot starting and ending at their respective depot, the total travel cost for each tour, and the overall total travel cost for both tours combined.]
