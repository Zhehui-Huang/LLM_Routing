- [There are 19 cities including 2 depot cities for the robots to start and end their tours.]
- [City coordinates are provided for calculating distances.]
- [There are 2 robots, and each has a designated starting and ending depot (Robot 0 starts and ends at depot city 0, Robot 1 starts and ends at depot city 1).]
- [Robots must collectively visit all cities exactly once and then return to their respective depots.]
- [Each city should be visited exactly once by the robots combined.]
- [The objective is to minimize the total travel cost for all robots combined, with the total travel cost being the sum of the individual tours' costs.]
- [Travel cost is calculated using the Euclidean distance between two cities.]
- [The solution should be executed as an Ant Colony Optimization algorithm with specific parameters like antnum (number of artificial ants), cyclenum (number of cycles without improvement before termination), inittrail (initial pheromone amount), alpha (influence of pheromone trails), beta (influence of heuristic information), and rho (pheromone evaporation rate).]
- [The algorithm includes steps for solution construction, transition probability calculation, trail updates with evaporation and pheromone addition, and terminates based on a defined stopping criterion related to lack of improvement.]
- [The output must include the tour for each robot starting and ending at their respective depots, the total travel cost of each tour, and the overall combined total travel cost.]
