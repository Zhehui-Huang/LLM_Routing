- [There are 22 cities with given coordinates.]
- [There are 4 robots, each with a unique depot city.]
- [Each robot starts and ends its tour at its designated depot city.]
- [Travel cost is calculated based on the Euclidean distance between two cities.]
- [Robots must collectively visit all cities exactly once and then return to their respective depots.]
- [Objective is to determine the shortest possible tours for each robot while minimizing the total travel cost for all robots combined.]
- [Solutions are to be constructed by computational agents simulating ants looking for shortest paths based on pheromone trails influenced by distance and prior successful routes.]
- [Pheromone trails on paths are initialized and then updated based on the tours constructed by the ants, considering both evaporation and addition of pheromone based on tour efficiency.]
- [Algorithm terminates when no improvement is found in the best solution for a specified number of cycles.]
