- [Requirement 1] Each robot must start and end its tour at its assigned depot.
- [Requirement 2] Each city must be visited exactly once by the robots collectively.
- [Requirement 3] The travel cost between cities is calculated using the Euclidean distance formula.
- [Requirement 4] The objective is to minimize the total travel cost for all robots combined.
- [Requirement 5] The travel cost for each robot's tour and the overall total travel cost must be provided in the output.
- [Requirement 6] Tours for each robot should be represented as a list that includes the starting depot, the cities visited, and the depot again.
- [Requirement 7] The ant colony optimization algorithm is used, taking into account parameters for pheromone influence, heuristic influence, and pheromone evaporation.
- [Requirement 8] The ant colony system introduces the pheromone values for paths and updates these paths using the formulae provided.
- [Requirement 9] Transition probabilities for the ants depend on both the pheromone values and heuristic information (inverse distance).
- [Requirement 10] The program should stop based on a defined criterion of consecutive cycles with no improvement.
