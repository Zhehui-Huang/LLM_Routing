- [Requirement 1] Each robot starts and ends its tour at its assigned depot city.
- [Requirement 2] Each robot must visit each city exactly once across all tours, and no city is visited more than once.
- [Requirement 3] The objective is to minimize the total travel cost for all robots combined, calculated as the Euclidean distance between cities.
- [Requirement 4] The output should include the tour for each robot as a list of city indices starting and ending at the assigned depot.
- [Requirement 5] The output should provide the total travel cost for each individual tour and the overall total travel cost.
- [Requirement 6] The algorithm should use an Ant Colony Optimization approach with the specified parameters for the number of ants, cycles, initial pheromone trail, influence of pheromone trail (alpha), influence of heuristic information (beta), and pheromone evaporation rate (rho).
- [Requirement 7] Transition probabilities for ants moving between cities rely on both pheromone levels and the heuristic value of the distance.
- [Requirement 8] Pheromones on paths need to be updated through evaporation and addition based on tours constructed by ants.
- [Requirement 9] The algorithm stops if there is no improvement in the best solution for a specified number of cycles.
- [Requirement 10] Special conditions must be considered where ants must return to depots if they reach maximum allowed cities or to ensure feasibility regarding the minimum number of cities for subsequent tours.
