- [Each robot starts and ends its journey at a designated depot city, corresponding to its unique identifier.]
- [Robots must collectively visit all 16 cities exactly once and subsequently return to their respective starting depots.]
- [The travel cost between cities is calculated using the Euclidean distance.]
- [The aim is to determine the shortest possible tours for each robot while minimizing the combined total travel cost for all robots.]
- [The transition probability for each robot to move from one city to another is influenced by the amount of pheromone on the path and the heuristic value which is usually the inverse of the distance between two cities.]
- [Special rules can modify robot paths, such as returning to the depot when a robot has visited the maximum number of cities allowed or continuing would prevent subsequent visits to remaining cities.]
- [Pheromone trails on paths are updated after each round: reduced by a factor reflecting the evaporation rate and increased based on the tours completed by the robots.]
- [The process continues until no improvement is made in the best tour for a specified number of consecutive cycles.]
- [The output includes a list of city indices for each robot indicating the tour and the individual and total costs of these tours.]
- [Each robotâ€™s tour must be properly formatted to start and end at its assigned depot.]
- [Overall efficiency is calculated as the sum of individual tour costs across all robots.]
