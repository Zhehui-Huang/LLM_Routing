- [There are 16 cities with given coordinates, including 8 depot cities and 8 additional cities.]
- [There are 8 robots, each with a unique starting and ending depot city.]
- [The social function is based on the shortest possible tours for each robot while minimizing the total travel cost for all robots combined.]
- [Each robot must start and end its journey at its assigned depot city.]
- [Each city must be visited exactly once by some robot, and then each robot must return to its starting depot.]
- [Travel cost is measured by the Euclidean distance between cities.]
- [The system involves constructing solutions using a metaheuristic approach, specifically an Ant Colony Optimization variant, with parameters including number of ants, number of cycles without improvement for termination, initial pheromone amount, influence of pheromone trails (alpha), influence of heuristic information (beta), and pheromone evaporation rate (rho).]
- [Each solution cycle involves each ant constructing a complete tour starting from a randomly selected depot, choosing subsequent cities based on a probabilistic formula that considers pheromone levels and the inverse of distances, and returning to the depot after visiting a number of cities.]
- [Pheromone trails are updated after each cycle through evaporation and addition based on the tours constructed by the ants.]
- [The algorithm terminates when there is no improvement in the best solution for a set number of consecutive cycles.]
- [Output results should detail the tour for each robot starting and ending at its depot and the travel cost for each tour, together with the total travel cost for all tours combined.]
