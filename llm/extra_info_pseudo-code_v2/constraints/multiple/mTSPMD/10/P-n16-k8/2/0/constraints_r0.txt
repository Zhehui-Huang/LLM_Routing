- [Requirement 1] Each robot must start and end its tour at its designated depot city.
- [Requirement 2] Each city must be visited exactly once by the robots collectively.
- [Requirement 3] The objective is to minimize the total travel cost for all robots combined, which is calculated based on the Euclidean distance between cities.
- [Requirement 4] Cities are defined by their coordinate pairs, and there are 16 cities, including 8 depot cities.
- [Requirement 5] There are 8 robots, each assigned to a specific starting and ending depot.
- [Requirement 6] The solution structure must include individual tours for each robot, specifying the sequence of city visits, beginning and ending at their assigned depots.
- [Requirement 7] The solution must include a total travel cost for each tour and an overall total travel cost combining all individual tour costs.
- [Requirement 8] Apply an Ant Colony Optimization algorithm with specified operations such as solution construction based on transition probabilities, pheromone trail update with evaporation and addition, and a stopping criterion based on a number of successive cycles with no improvement in the best solution.
- [Requirement 9] Transition probabilities for moving from one city to another are influenced by both the amount of pheromone on that path and an inverse heuristic related to the distance.
- [Requirement 10] Adaptation in solution construction such as returning to the depot when maximum possible cities or minimum required cities for subsequent tours considerations come into play.
- [Requirement 11] The pheromone model includes evaporation and addition processes adhering to the described formulas and conditions for pheromone update after each cycle.
- [Requirement 12] Initialization includes setting up parameters such as the number of artificial ants, cycles of no improvement till termination, initial pheromone levels, influence of pheromone trails (alpha), influence of heuristic information (beta), and pheromone evaporation rate (rho).
- [Requirement 13] Use a structured approach, starting with initialization, followed by cycles of solution construction and trail updates, and concluding once a stopping criterion related to solution improvement is met.
