- [There are 23 cities, each with specific coordinates provided.]
- [The problem involves 8 robots, each starting and ending at designated depot cities.]
- [Each robot must visit all cities exactly once, ensuring no city is visited more than once by any robot.]
- [The objective is to minimize the total travel cost for all robots combined.]
- [Travel cost between any two cities is calculated based on the Euclidean distance.]
- [The problem must be solved using an algorithm based on artificial ants, considering parameters such as antnum, cyclenum, inittrail, alpha, beta, and rho.]
- [Ants construct solutions by starting at a randomly selected depot, choosing the next city to visit based on specific transition probabilities, and returning to the initial depot after visiting all required cities.]
- [The algorithm includes mechanisms for pheromone trail update, including evaporation and addition based on the tours constructed by the ants.]
- [The algorithm repeatedly executes in cycles and stops when there's no improvement in the best solution for a predefined number of successive cycles, specified by cyclenum.]
- [The output of the solution should detail the tour of each robot beginning and ending at their respective depots and indicate the individual and total travel costs accurately.]
