- [There are 21 cities, including 2 depot cities.]
- [Each robot starts and ends its tour at a designated depot city (Robot 0 at city 0 and Robot 1 at city 1).]
- [Robots must visit all cities exactly once between them, and no city is visited by more than one robot.]
- [The travel cost between any two cities is calculated using the Euclidean distance formula.]
- [The total objective is to minimize the combined travel cost of all robots.]
- [The output should include individual tours for each robot starting and ending at their respective depots, the travel cost for each tour, and the overall total travel cost.]
- [The system should use an algorithm involving artificial ants, pheromone trails, heuristic information, and should be able to terminate based on a defined no-improvement condition (cyclenum).]
- [Tour construction for each ant involves choosing the next city based on a probabilistic rule weighted by pheromone intensity and inverse of distance (heuristic).]
- [Pheromone trails update through evaporation and addition based on the tours constructed by ants.]
