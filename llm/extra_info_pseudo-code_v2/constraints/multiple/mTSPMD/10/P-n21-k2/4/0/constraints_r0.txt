- [The environment comprises 21 cities, each identified with coordinates.]
- [There are two robots, each starting and ending at a different depot city.]
- [The objective is to create tours where each robot visits all cities exactly once and then returns to its assigned starting depot.]
- [Travel cost is calculated based on the Euclidean distance between cities.]
- [The algorithm must minimize the overall travel cost for both robots combined.]
- [Each city must be visited exactly once by the robot team, ensuring an efficient tour cycle that avoids repeat visits to any city except the depots.]
- [Travel is capable between any pair of cities.]
- [Use of an ant colony optimization (ACO) algorithm as described, involving parameters for the number of ants, cycles with no improvement, initial pheromone trails, influence weights of pheromone and heuristic information, and pheromone evaporation rate.]
- [Pheromone trail values need initialization and updates based on travel paths, incorporating mechanisms for evaporation and addition from solutions constructed by ants.]
- [Transition probabilities for moving from one city to another are dictated by the existing pheromone trail and inverse of the distance, modified by defined algorithmic parameters.]
- [The ant algorithm involves constructing tours starting from a randomly chosen depot, with rules to return to the depot based on conditions related to the maximum number and minimum number of cities that can be visited before necessitating a return.]
- [Algorithm iterates through cycles, continuing until no improvement in the best solution is observed across a specified number of cycles.]
- [Output specifications require listing each robot's tour beginning and ending at its depot, including the total travel cost per tour and the combined cost for all tours.]
