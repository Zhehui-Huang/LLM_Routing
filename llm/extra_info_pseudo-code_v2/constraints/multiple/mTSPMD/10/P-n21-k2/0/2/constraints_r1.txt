- [There are 21 cities with specified coordinates, including 2 depot cities.]
- [2 robots are available, each starting and ending at their respective depots.]
- [Travel between cities is based on Euclidean distance.]
- [Each robot's tour must start and end at the assigned depot city.]
- [All cities must be visited exactly once by either robot.]
- [The objective is to minimize the total travel cost for all combined tours of the robots.]
- [Output should include the tour of each robot starting and ending at its depot and the travel cost for each tour, plus the overall travel cost.]
