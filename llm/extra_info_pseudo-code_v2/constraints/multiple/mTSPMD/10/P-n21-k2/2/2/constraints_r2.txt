- [There are 21 cities with specified coordinates.]
- [There are 2 robots with specific starting and ending depots.]
- [Robots must collectively visit all cities exactly once and return to their respective depots.]
- [Objective is to determine the shortest possible tours for each robot while minimizing the total travel cost for all robots combined.]
- [Tour must start and end at the robot's assigned depot.]
- [Travel cost is calculated as the Euclidean distance between two cities.]
- [Use an ant colony optimization algorithm with parameters such as antnum, cyclenum, inittrail, alpha, beta, and rho.]
- [Transition probabilities for ants are based on pheromone strength and heuristic information, with special cases to ensure feasible tours.]
- [Pheromone trails are updated through evaporation and addition based on tour quality.]
- [The algorithm terminates after no improvement in the best solution for a predefined number of cycles.]
- [Output must include the tour for each robot and the travel costs for individual tours and the overall total travel cost.]
