- [There are 21 cities in total with specified coordinates.]
- [There are two depots: Depot city 0 (30, 40) and Depot city 1 (37, 52).]
- [There are two robots: Robot 0 starts and ends at Depot 0, and Robot 1 starts and ends at Depot 1.]
- [Travel between any two cities is possible for the robots.]
- [The travel cost is calculated as the Euclidean distance between two cities.]
- [Robots must collectively visit all cities exactly once and then return to their respective depots.]
- [Each city is to be visited exactly once by any one of the robots, not collectively.]
- [Each robot must return to its starting depot after completing its tour.]
- [The total route cost for each robot and the combined cost across robots must be minimized.]
- [The solution should output the tour sequence and total travel cost for each robot, and the combined travel cost for all tours.]
