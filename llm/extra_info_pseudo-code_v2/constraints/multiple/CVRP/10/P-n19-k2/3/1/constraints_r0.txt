- [There are 19 cities, each with specific coordinates and a unique demand.]
- [The problem involves 2 robots, each with a carrying capacity of 160.]
- [Travel cost between cities is measured using the Euclidean distance.]
- [Robots must start and end their tours at the depot city (city 0).]
- [Total demand of all cities, excluding the depot, must be met by the robots.]
- [The capacity constraints of the robots must not be violated.]
- [The task is to minimize the total travel cost for all tours.]
- [The resulting tours and the travel costs for each robot and the overall cost need to be displayed as specified.]
