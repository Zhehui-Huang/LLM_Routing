- [There are 19 cities, including a depot city (City 0).]
- [Each city has specific coordinates and a demand for goods that needs to be met.]
- [There are 2 robots with a capacity of 160 units each.]
- [All robots start at the depot city 0.]
- [Robots can travel between any two cities.]
- [Travel costs between cities are calculated using Euclidean distance.]
- [The objective is to minimize the total travel cost for all robot tours.]
- [Each robot's tour should start and end at the depot city 0.]
- [City demand must be fully met without exceeding the capacity constraints of the robots.]
- [The solution must provide the tours for each robot as a list of city indices.]
- [The solution must also output the total travel cost for each tour and the overall total travel cost.]
- [The solution should ideally use a variant of the Clarke-Wright Savings Algorithm with enhancements for better performance.]
