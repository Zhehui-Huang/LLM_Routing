- [There are 19 cities including the depot city which has index 0.]
- [Each city has specific coordinates and demand values.]
- [There are 2 robots, each starting from the depot city 0.]
- [Each robot has a capacity of 160 units.]
- [The goal is for robots to deliver goods to all cities (excluding the depot) and return to the depot after deliveries.]
- [Each city demand must be fully met by the deliveries.]
- [The capacity constraints of each robot must not be exceeded when planning the routes.]
- [The travel cost between two cities is calculated based on the Euclidean distance between their coordinates.]
- [The output should list tours for each robot starting and ending at the depot and include the total travel cost for each robot's tour and overall total travel cost.]
- [The objective is to minimize the total travel cost for all tours.]
