- [There are 19 cities including the depot city, each identified by an index from 0 to 18.]
- [Each city has a specific set of Cartesian coordinates.]
- [Each city (excluding the depot) has a specified demand that must be fulfilled.]
- [There are 2 robots available for delivering goods to the cities.]
- [Each robot has a carrying capacity of 160 units.]
- [All robots start and finish their routes at the depot city, indexed as 0.]
- [The robots can travel between any two cities.]
- [The travel cost between two cities is calculated using the Euclidean distance formula.]
- [The objective is to minimize the total travel cost for all robots.]
- [The routes designed must ensure that the demand of each city is met and that the capacity constraints of the robots are not exceeded.]
- [Each robot's tour should be presented in a list starting and ending at the depot city.]
- [The individual and overall travel costs of the routes should be provided.]
