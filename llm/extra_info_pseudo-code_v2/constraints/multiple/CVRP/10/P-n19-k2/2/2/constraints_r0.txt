- [There are 19 cities with coordinates provided.]
- [Each city has a specific demand value that must be met by the robots.]
- [There are 2 robots with a carrying capacity of 160 each, starting from the depot city 0.]
- [Travel cost between two cities is calculated as the Euclidean distance.]
- [Robots must deliver goods to all cities, excluding the depot city, and then return to the city depot city.]
- [The objective is to determine the shortest possible tours for the robots while ensuring that the demand of each city is fully met and the capacity constraints of the robots are not exceeded.]
- [The solution must minimize the total travel cost for all tours.] 
- [Output tours for each robot must start and end at the depot city 0.]
- [Output the total travel cost for each robot's tour and the overall total travel cost.]
