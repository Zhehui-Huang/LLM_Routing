- [There are 19 cities with specified coordinates, including the depot city 0.]
- [Each city has a specified demand of goods that must be delivered by the robots.]
- [Two robots are available for delivering goods, both starting from depot city 0.]
- [Each robot has a carrying capacity of 160 units.]
- [The travel cost between two cities is calculated using the Euclidean distance.]
- [Robots must meet the demand of every city other than the depot city, without exceeding their capacity limits.]
- [Each robot's tour should start and end at the depot city 0.]
- [The objective is to minimize the total travel cost for all tours combined.]
- [The output should clearly specify the tour for each robot and the corresponding travel costs, including individual and overall total costs.]
