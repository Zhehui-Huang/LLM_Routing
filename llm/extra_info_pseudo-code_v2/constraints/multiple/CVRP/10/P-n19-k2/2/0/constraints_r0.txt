- [There are 19 cities with specified coordinates, starting from the depot city 0.]
- [Each city has a specific demand for goods, starting from the depot city with a demand of zero.]
- [There are 2 robots available for making deliveries, each with a capacity of 160 units.]
- [All robots start their journey from the depot city 0.]
- [Robots can travel between any two cities, and the travel cost is based on the Euclidean distance between cities.]
- [All cities, excluding the depot, must have their demands fully met by the robots' deliveries.]
- [The total load carried by any robot on its tour must not exceed its capacity of 160 units.]
- [Each robot must return to the depot city after completing its deliveries.]
- [The objective is to minimize the total travel cost for all tours conducted by the robots.]
- [Each tour's output should list the cities visited in order, beginning and ending at the depot city.]
- [Output needs to include the total travel cost for each robot's tour and the overall travel cost of all tours.]
