- [There are 22 cities, including the depot (city 0).]
- [Each city, excluding the depot, has a specific demand that must be met.]
- [There are 4 robots available for making deliveries.]
- [Each robot has a carrying capacity of 6000 units.]
- [All robots start their journey from the depot city (city 0).]
- [Robots can travel between any two cities.]
- [Travel cost is calculated based on the Euclidean distance between the cities.]
- [Each robot must return to the depot city after completing its deliveries.]
- [The overall objective is to minimize the total travel cost for all the robots.]
- [City demands must be fulfilled without exceeding the capacity constraints of each robot.]
