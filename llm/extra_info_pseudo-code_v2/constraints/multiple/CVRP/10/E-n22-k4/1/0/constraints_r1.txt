- [There are 22 cities with specified coordinates including a depot city (City 0).]
- [Each city has a defined demand amount that must be met.]
- [There are 4 robots, each with a capacity of 6000.]
- [All robots start their tours at the depot city 0.]
- [Travel cost between cities is determined by the Euclidean distance between them.]
- [The objective is to minimize the total travel cost for all tours.]
- [Each tour must start and end at the depot city 0.]
- [Each city's demand must be fully met by the collective work of the robots.]
- [The sum of the demands of the cities in each robot's tour must not exceed the robot's capacity.]
- [Output should include the tour for each robot as a list starting and ending at depot city 0, the travel cost for each tour, and the overall total travel cost.]
