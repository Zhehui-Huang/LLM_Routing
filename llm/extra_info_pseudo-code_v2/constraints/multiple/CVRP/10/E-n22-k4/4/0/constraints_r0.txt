- [There are 22 cities including a depot city (City 0).]
- [Each city has x and y coordinates defining its location.]
- [Each city has a specific demand for goods, except for the depot city which has a demand of 0.]
- [There are 4 robots available to deliver goods.]
- [Each robot has a carrying capacity of 6000 units.]
- [All robots start their delivery routes from the depot city.]
- [Travel cost between two cities is calculated as the Euclidean distance between their respective coordinates.]
- [Each robot's route must start and end at the depot city.]
- [The demand of each city must be fully met by the robots.]
- [The capacity constraints of the robots must not be exceeded.]
- [Solution needs to minimize the total travel cost for all tours.]
- [Tours for each robot and the respective travel costs must be clearly outputted.]
- [Overall total travel/travel cost must also be clearly outputted.]
