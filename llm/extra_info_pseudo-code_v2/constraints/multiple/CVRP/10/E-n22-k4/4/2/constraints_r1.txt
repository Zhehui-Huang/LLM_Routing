- [There are four robots available with a starting location at depot city 0.]
- [Each robot has a capacity of 6000 units.]
- [Travel cost is measured by the Euclidean distance between cities.]
- [The objective is to minimize the total travel cost for all tours.]
- [Robots must collectively deliver goods to all cities, fulfilling the specific demand of each city without exceeding their capacity.]
- [All routes must start and end at the depot city 0.]
- [Each city's demand ranges between 100 and 2500 units, with depot city having a demand of 0.]
- [The total supply by all robots must match the total demand of all cities.]
- [Provide the tours for each robot as a list of city indices.]
- [Output the total travel cost for each tour.]
- [Report the overall total travel cost.]
