- [There are 22 cities with specified coordinates and demands.]
- [City 0 is the depot city.]
- [There are 4 robots, each with a capacity of 6000.]
- [Robots must start and end their tours at the depot city 0.]
- [Travel cost is calculated as the Euclidean distance between cities.]
- [Robots must deliver goods to all cities (except the depot), fully meeting their demands.]
- [Capacity constraints of the robots must not be exceeded.]
- [Objective is to minimize the total travel cost for all tours, with each tour's cost calculated and reported.]
- [Output should be in the form of lists of city indices for each robot's tour, starting and ending at the depot city.]
- [Output should include the total travel cost for each robot's tour and the overall total travel cost.]
