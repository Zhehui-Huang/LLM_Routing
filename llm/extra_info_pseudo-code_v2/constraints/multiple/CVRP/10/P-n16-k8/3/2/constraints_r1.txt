- [There are 16 cities including the depot (city 0) with specific coordinates provided for each.]
- [Each city has a specific demand that must be met, excluding the depot which has a demand of 0.]
- [There are 8 robots available, each with a carrying capacity of 35.]
- [All robots start their tours at the depot city 0.]
- [Robots can travel between any two cities.]
- [Travel cost is calculated based on the Euclidean distance between two cities.]
- [The objective is to minimize the total travel cost for all tours of the robots.]
- [Each robot's route must start and end at the depot city 0.]
- [The carrying capacity of each robot must not be exceeded on any tour.]
- [Every city's demand must be fully met by the collective effort of the robots.]
- [Output must include the tour for each robot starting and ending at city 0, the travel cost for each tour, and the overall total travel for all tours.]
