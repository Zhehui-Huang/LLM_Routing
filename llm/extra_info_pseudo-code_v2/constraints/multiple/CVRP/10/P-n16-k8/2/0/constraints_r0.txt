- [There are 16 cities including the depot city, each with specified coordinates.]
- [Each city has a specified demand for goods that needs to be met, except the depot city which has a demand of 0.]
- [There are 8 robots available to perform deliveries.]
- [Each robot has a carrying capacity of 35 units.]
- [All robots start their deliveries from the depot city.]
- [Robots must return to the depot city after completing their deliveries.]
- [Travel cost between cities is calculated using the Euclidean distance.]
- [The objective is to minimize the total travel cost for all the tours.]
- [Each robot's total load on a tour should not exceed its carrying capacity.]
- [The solution must ensure that the demand of each city (except the depot) is fully met.]
