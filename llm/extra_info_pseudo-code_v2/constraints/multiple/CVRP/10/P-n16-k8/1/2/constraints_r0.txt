- [There are 16 cities including the depot city, and each city has specific coordinates.]
- [City 0 acts as the depot city with coordinates (30, 40).]
- [Each city has a specific demand for goods that must be fully met.]
- [There are 8 robots available for making deliveries.]
- [Each robot starts from the depot city 0.]
- [Each robot has a carrying capacity of 35 units.]
- [Travel cost between cities is calculated using the Euclidean distance.]
- [Robots are required to return to the depot city after completing their deliveries.]
- [The objective is to minimize the total travel cost for all tours.]
- [The tours for each robot must start and end at the depot city 0.]
- [The output should specify the tour for each robot as a list of city indices.]
- [The output should also provide the total travel cost for each robotâ€™s tour and the overall total travel cost.]
- [Ensure that all city demands are met without exceeding the robot's carrying capacity.]
- [Utilize an enhanced Clarke-Wright Savings Algorithm for route optimization.]
