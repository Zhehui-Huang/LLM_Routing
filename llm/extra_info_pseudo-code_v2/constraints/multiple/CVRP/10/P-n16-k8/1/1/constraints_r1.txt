- [There are 16 cities including the depot city 0.]
- [Each city has a specified x, y coordinate.]
- [Each city except the depot has a specified demand quantity that must be met.]
- [There are 8 robots and each has a maximum carrying capacity of 35 units.]
- [All robots start their journey from the depot city 0.]
- [Travel cost between cities is calculated using the Euclidean distance formula.]
- [Robots must collectively deliver goods to all cities and return to the depot city after their routes are complete.]
- [The objective is to minimize the total accumulated travel cost for all robots.]
- [Outputs should include a list of tours for each robot, where each tour starts and ends at city 0.]
- [Outputs should also include the travel cost for each tour and the combined travel cost for all tours.]
- [The tours should be arranged such that no robot exceeds its carrying capacity of 35 units.]
- [Every cityâ€™s demand must be fully met by the end of the delivery tours.]
