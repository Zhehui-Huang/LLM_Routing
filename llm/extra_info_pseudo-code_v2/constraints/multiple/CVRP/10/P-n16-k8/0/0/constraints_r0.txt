- [Each robot must start and end its tour at the depot city (city 0).]
- [The demand of each city must be fully met.]
- [The capacity constraints of each robot must not be exceeded.]
- [Minimize the total travel cost for all tours.]
- [Each city has predetermined coordinates and must be visited by one of the robots.]
- [The travel cost is calculated as the Euclidean distance between cities.]
- [There are 16 cities in total, including the depot city.]
- [There are 8 robots available for the task.]
