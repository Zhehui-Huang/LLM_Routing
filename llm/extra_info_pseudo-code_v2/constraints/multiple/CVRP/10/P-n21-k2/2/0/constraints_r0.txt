- [Each robot starts and ends its tour at the depot city (city 0).]
- [The total demand of each city must be fully met by the robots.]
- [The carrying capacity of each robot (160 units) must not be exceeded.]
- [The objective is to minimize the total travel cost for all tours combined.]
- [Cities have specific demand values the robots need to deliver.]
- [All robots can travel between any two cities.]
- [Travel cost between two cities is calculated using the Euclidean distance.]
- [Output the tours for each robot as a list of city indices starting and ending at city 0.]
- [Output the total travel cost for each tour and the overall total cost.]
