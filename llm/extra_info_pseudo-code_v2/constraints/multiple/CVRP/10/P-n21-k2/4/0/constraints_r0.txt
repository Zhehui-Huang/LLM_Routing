- [Cities and their coordinates, with city 0 being the depot city.]
- [Each city has a specific demand that must be met.]
- [Number of robots: 2]
- [The capacity of each robot: 160.]
- [All robots start at depot city 0.]
- [Travel cost is the Euclidean distance between two cities.]
- [Each robot must return to the depot city after completing their deliveries.]
- [The objective is to minimize the total travel cost for all tours.]
- [Ensure that the demand of each city is met.]
- [Ensure that the capacity constraints of each robot are not exceeded.]
