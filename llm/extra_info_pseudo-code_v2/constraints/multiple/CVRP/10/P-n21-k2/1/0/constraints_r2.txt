- There are 21 cities with specified coordinates, including a depot city.
- Each city except the depot has a specific demand that the robots need to satisfy.
- There are 2 robots, each with a carrying capacity of 160 units.
- All robots start and end their tours at the depot city 0.
- The travel cost calculation is based on the Euclidean distance between cities.
- The goal is to minimize the total travel cost for all robot tours.
- Ensure that no robot's carrying capacity is exceeded during any part of the tour.
- Each robot's route should start and end at the depot city.
- The output should list the tours for each robot as a sequence of city indices, starting and ending at city 0.
- The solution should correctly report the total travel cost for each individual tour and the cumulative travel cost for all tours.
- It is essential to meet the demand of each city through the distribution made by the robots.
