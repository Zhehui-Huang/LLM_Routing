- [There are 21 cities with given coordinates.]
- [Each city has a specified demand that must be met.]
- [Two robots are available for delivery, each with a capacity of 160.]
- [All robots start at the depot city 0.]
- [Robots must deliver goods to all cities excluding the depot city and return to the depot city after completing their deliveries.]
- [Travel cost is calculated as the Euclidean distance between two cities.]
- [The objective is to determine the shortest possible tours for the robots while ensuring the demand of each city is met and the capacity constraints of the robots are not exceeded.]
- [Minimize the total travel cost for all tours.]
- [Tours for each robot should start and end at the depot city 0.]
- [Output the tours for each robot as a list of city indices.]
- [Output the total travel concentrate for each tour and the combined overall total travel cost.]
