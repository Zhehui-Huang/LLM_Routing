- [There are 23 cities with specified coordinates.]
- [Each city has a specific demand that must be met.]
- [There are 8 robots with a capacity of 40 each.]
- [All robots start and end their tour at the depot city (city 0).]
- [Travel cost is calculated as the Euclidean distance between two cities.]
- [The task is to determine the shortest possible tours for the robots.]
- [Each robot's tour must ensure that the capacity constraints are not exceeded.]
- [Overall goal is to minimize the total travel cost for all tours.]
- [Output should include the tour for each robot starting and ending at city 0, the total travel cost for each tour, and the overall total travel cost.]
