- [There are 23 cities including the depot city 0.]
- [Cities have specific coordinates provided for computing Euclidean distances.]
- [Each city has a specific demand that must be met.]
- [There are 8 robots, each with a capacity of 40.]
- [All robots start from the depot city 0.]
- [Robots can travel between any two cities.]
- [Travel cost is calculated using the Euclidean distance between two cities.]
- [The robots must deliver goods to all cities, excluding the depot city, then return to the depot.]
- [The robots' carrying capacity should not be exceeded.]
- [Minimize the total travel cost for all tours.]
- [Each cityâ€™s demand must be fully met.]
- [Each tour for the robots should start and end at the depot city 0.]
- [Output the route for each robot as a list of city indices.]
- [Output the total travel cost for each individual tour.]
- [Output the overall total travel general cost.]
