- [There are 23 cities, each uniquely identified and represented with specific coordinates]
- [City 0 serves as the depot city]
- [Each city has a specific demand that must be met by the delivery of goods]
- [There are 8 robots available for making deliveries]
- [Each robot has a capacity limit of 40 units]
- [All robots start their tours at the depot city 0]
- [Robots can travel between any two cities]
- [Travel cost between cities is calculated using the Euclidean distance formula]
- [The objective is to deliver goods to all cities (except the depot city) and return to the depot city after completing deliveries]
- [Each city's demand must be fully satisfied without exceeding the robot's carrying capacity]
- [The total travel cost for all tours should be minimized]
- [Output should include specific tours for each robot starting and ending at city 0, the travel costs for each tour, and the overall total travel cost]
- [The tours should ensure no demand is left unfilled and no robot's capacity is exceeded]
