- [Requirement 1] The robots must start and end their tours at the depot city (City 0).
- [Requirement 2] Each city's demand must be fully met by the deliveries made by the robots.
- [Requirement 3] The carrying capacity of each robot cannot be exceeded at any time during the tours.
- [Requirement 4] Minimize the total travel cost for all robot tours.
- [Requirement 5] The objective is to determine the shortest possible tours for the robots.
- [Requirement 6] Each robot has a defined maximum travel capability to move between cities, respecting the city's coordinates and calculating distances using the Euclidean formula.
- [Requirement 7] Task must be achieved with the given number of robots (8 robots).
- [Requirement 8] Output should list each robot's tour starting and ending at the depot and include the tour's total travel cost as well as the overall travel cost across all tours.
- [Requirement 9] The algorithm used should incorporate strategies to avoid local optima, such as probabilistic re-ranking of saving costs and applying local search procedures on routes.
- [Requirement 10] Implement routine improvements via iterating local search methods that may include moving and swapping cities within and between routes to enhance the solution quality.
