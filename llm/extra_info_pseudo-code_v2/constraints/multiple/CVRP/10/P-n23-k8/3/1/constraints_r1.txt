- [There are 23 cities, and each city has specific coordinates.]
- [City 0 is the depot city with coordinates (30, 40) and a demand of 0.]
- [Cities have varying demands, ranging from 5 to 30.]
- [There are 8 robots available for delivery, each with a capacity of 40.]
- [All robots start their routes from the depot city 0.]
- [Robots can travel between any two cities.]
- [Travel cost is calculated as the Euclidean distance between two cities.]
- [The robots must deliver goods to all cities, excluding the depot city.]
- [After completing their deliveries, all robots must return to the depot city.]
- [The objective is to determine the shortest possible tours for the robots.]
- [Each robot's capacity must not be exceeded during the deliveries.]
- [Each city's demand must be fully met by the robots.]
- [Minimize the total travel cost for all tours.]
