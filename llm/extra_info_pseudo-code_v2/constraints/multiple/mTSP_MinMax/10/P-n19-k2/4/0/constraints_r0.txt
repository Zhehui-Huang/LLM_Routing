- [Deploy two robots to visit 19 cities, each starting and ending their travel at the depot city 0.]
- [Each city, excluding the depot city, must be visited exactly once by any of the robots.]
- [The travel cost is determined by the Euclidean distance between two cities.]
- [The primary objective is to minimize the maximum travel distance covered by any of the robots.]
- [All tours must begin from and return to the depot city 0.]
- [The tours for each robot must be output as a list of city indices, starting and ending at the depot city 0.]
- [The output must include the travel cost for each tour and the maximum travel cost among all tours.]
- [Utilize the General Variable Neighborhood Search (GVNS) algorithm to find optimal tours.]
