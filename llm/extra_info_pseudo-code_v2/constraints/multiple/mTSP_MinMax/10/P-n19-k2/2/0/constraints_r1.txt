- [There are 19 cities including the depot city 0, each with specific coordinates.]
- [There are 2 robots, both starting and ending their tours at the depot city 0.]
- [Each robot must collectively visit all cities exactly once, excluding the depot city as a destination, and then return to the depot.]
- [Travel costs between cities are calculated using the Euclidean distance.]
- [The primary objective is to minimize the maximum distance traveled by any single robot.]
- [Ensure that every city, except the depot, is visited exactly once by any robot.]
- [Output should include the tours for each robot starting and ending at the depot city, the travel cost for each tour, and the maximum travel cost among all tours.]
