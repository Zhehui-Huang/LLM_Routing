- [There are 19 cities including the depot city.]
- [Each robot starts and ends its tour at the depot city 0.]
- [The objective is to minimize the maximum distance traveled by any single robot.]
- [Each city, except the depot, must be visited exactly once by the robots collectively.]
- [Travel cost between any two cities is calculated as the Euclidean distance.]
- [Output should include the tours for each robot, beginning and ending at the depot city.]
- [Output should include the total travel cost for each tour and the maximum travel cost among all tours.]
