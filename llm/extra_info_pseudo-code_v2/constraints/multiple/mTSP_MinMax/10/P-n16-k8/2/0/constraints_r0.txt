- [There are 16 cities, including a depot city 0.]
- [All robots start at the depot city 0.]
- [Robots must visit all cities exactly once, excluding the depot city, and then return to the depot city.]
- [Travel between cities is calculated using the Euclidean distance.]
- [The main objective is to minimize the maximum distance traveled by any single robot.]
- [Eight robots are available for the task.]
- [Each tour must start and end at the depot city 0.]
- [Output should include the tours for each robot as a list of city indices and the travel cost for each tour, as well as the maximum travel cost among all tours.]
