- [There are 16 cities with specific x, y coordinates; the depot city is city 0.]
- [There are 8 robots, all starting at the depot city.]
- [Robots can travel between any two cities with travel costs as Euclidean distances.]
- [Each city (except the depot) must be visited exactly once by the robots.]
- [Each robot must start and end its tour at the depot.]
- [The primary goal is to minimize the maximum distance traveled by any single robot.]
