- [There are 16 cities including the depot.]
- [Robots must visit all cities exactly once, excluding the depot city as a destination.]
- [Each robot starts and ends its tour at the depot city 0.]
- [Minimize the maximum distance traveled by any single robot.]
- [Travel cost between two cities is calculated as the Euclidean distance.]
- [Number of robots is 8, all starting at city 0.]
- [Output should present the tours for each robot starting and ending at the depot, along with the travel cost for each tour and the maximum travel cost among all the tours.]
