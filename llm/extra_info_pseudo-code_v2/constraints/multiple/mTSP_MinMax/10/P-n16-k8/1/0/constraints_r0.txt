- [There are 16 cities including the depot city.]
- [All robots start at the depot city, which is city 0.]
- [Robots must collectively visit each city exactly once, excluding the depot city as a destination, and return to the depot city after completing their tours.]
- [The travel cost is calculated as the Euclidean distance between two cities.]
- [The main objective is to minimize the maximum distance traveled by any single robot.]
- [There are 8 robots available for the task.]
- [The tours for each robot must start and end at the depot city 0.]
- [The output should list the tours and the total travel cost for each robot, as well as the maximum travel cost among all the tours.]
