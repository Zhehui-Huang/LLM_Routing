- [There are 23 cities with given coordinates for each, including a depot city (city 0).]
- [All robots start and end their tours at the depot city (city 0).]
- [Each robot must collectively visit all cities exactly once, except the depot city.]
- [The primary objective is to minimize the maximum distance traveled by any single robot.]
- [Travel cost is calculated as the Euclidean distance between two cities.]
- [Use the General Variable Neighborhood Search (GVNS) algorithm with initialization, shaking, sequential variable neighborhood descent, and main loop phases for optimization.]
- [Output for each robot should include the tour starting and ending at the depot city (city 0) and the travel cost for each one.]
- [Output should also show the maximum travel cost among all tours.]
