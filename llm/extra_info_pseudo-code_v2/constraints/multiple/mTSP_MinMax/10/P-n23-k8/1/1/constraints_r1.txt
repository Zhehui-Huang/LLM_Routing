- [There are 23 cities, each with precise coordinates provided.]
- [There are 8 robots, all starting at the Depot city 0.]
- [Robots can travel between any two cities.]
- [Travel cost between cities is calculated using the Euclidean distance.]
- [Robots must visit each city exactly once, excluding the depot city, and then return to the depot after completing their tours.]
- [Each robot tour starts and ends at the depot city.]
- [The primary objective is to minimize the maximum distance traveled by any single robot.] 
- [Complete the task using a General Variable Neighborhood Search (GVNS) algorithm based on the provided pseudocode.] 
- [Output the tours for each robot as a list of city indices. Each tour should start and end at the depot city 0.] 
- [Output the travel cost for each tour and the maximum travel cost among all tours.]
