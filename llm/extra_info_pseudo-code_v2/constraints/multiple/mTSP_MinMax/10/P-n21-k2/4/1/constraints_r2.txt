- [The environment comprises 21 cities with specified coordinates.]
- [There are 2 robots starting from a depot city labeled as 0.]
- [Travel cost is calculated using Euclidean distance between cities.]
- [Each robot must start and end its route at the depot city.]
- [Every city (excluding the depot) must be visited exactly once by any of the robots.]
- [The objective is to minimize the maximum distance traveled by any single robot.]
- [Use GVNS algorithm to find a solution which includes initialization, shaking, sequential variable neighborhood descent, and a terminating condition.]
- [Output should list tours for each robot starting and ending at the depot city, the total travel cost of these tours, and the maximum travel cost among them.]
