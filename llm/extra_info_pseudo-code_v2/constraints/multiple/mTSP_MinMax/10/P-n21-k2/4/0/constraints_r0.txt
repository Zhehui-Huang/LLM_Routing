- [There are 21 cities, including the depot city 0.]
- [Each robot must start and end its tour at depot city 0.]
- [All cities, except the depot, must be visited exactly once by the robots collectively.]
- [Travel cost is calculated as the Euclidean distance between two cities.]
- [The objective is to minimize the maximum distance traveled by any of the robots.]
- [Output the tours for each robot as a list of city indices, starting and ending at the depot city 0.]
- [Output the travel cost for each tour and the maximum travel cost among all tours.]
