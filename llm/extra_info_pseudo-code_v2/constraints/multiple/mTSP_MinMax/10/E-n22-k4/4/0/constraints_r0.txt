- [Environment contains 22 cities, including the depot city 0.]
- [Coordinates for each city are provided.]
- [There are 4 robots, all starting from the depot city 0.]
- [Robots can travel between any two cities.]
- [Travel cost is the Euclidean distance between two cities.]
- [Each robot must start and end at the depot city.]
- [Each city, except the depot, must be visited exactly once by the robots collectively.]
- [The objective is to minimize the maximum distance traveled by any single robot.]
- [Output should include tours for each robot beginning and ending at city 0, travel costs for each tour, and the maximum travel cost among all tours.]
