- [There are 23 cities, including 7 depot cities and 16 other cities, each identified by unique indices from 0 to 22 with corresponding coordinates.]
- [There are 8 robots in total, all initially starting from depot city 0.]
- [Robots can travel between any two cities, calculating travel cost based on the Euclidean distance between those cities.]
- [Each city must be visited exactly once by any of the robots without returning to the starting depot unless it is part of the optimal path.]
- [The task is to find the shortest tours for each robot that minimize total travel cost collectively for all robots combined.]
- [Output should include each robot's tour as a list of city indices starting and potentially ending at a designated depot, the travel cost for each tour, and the overall total travel cost.]
- [The genetic algorithm utilizes a specialized chromosome representation, crossover methods, mutation operators, and parent selection strategies to evolve towards an optimal solution set across several generations.]
- [Conditions apply based on genetic algorithm settings including generation count, population size, crossover rate, mutation rate, and reproduction rate.]
- [Chromosome structure integrates cities and depots in a sequence that allows splitting into valid tours for multiple robots.]
