- [There are 23 cities, including 7 depot cities and 16 regular cities. Coordinates for all cities are provided.]
- [Eight robots are available, all starting at depot city 0.]
- [Each robot can travel between any two cities; travel costs are calculated using Euclidean distance.]
- [The objective is for robots to collectively visit all cities exactly once, ensuring each city is visited only once, and each robot starts and ends at a designated depot.]
- [The main goal is to minimize the total travel cost for all robots combined, optimizing the shortest tours for each robot.]
- [Every robot does not need to return to the starting depot after completing its tour.]
- [Output the tours for each robot as a list of city indices, starting and ending at its assigned depot.]
- [Output the total travel cost for each robot's tour and the overall total travel cost.]
- [Use a genetic algorithm with specific strategies for chromosome representation, initial population generation, crossover, mutation, and parent selection.]
- [Parameters for the genetic algorithm are specified, including the number of generations, crossover rate, mutation rate, and more.]
