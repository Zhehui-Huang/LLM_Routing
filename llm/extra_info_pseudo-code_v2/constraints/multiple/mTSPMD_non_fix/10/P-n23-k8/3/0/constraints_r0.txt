- [Each robot must visit all cities exactly once, where each city is visited by only one robot.]
- [Each tour must start at a designated depot but does not need to end at the starting depot; robots can stop at any city as their endpoint.]
- [The overall objective is to minimize the total travel cost across all robots.]
- [Travel cost is calculated as the Euclidean distance between two cities.]
- [The robots start the tours from depot city 0.]
- [The number of robots available is 8.]
- [The chromosome representation in the genetic algorithm includes a permutation of the integers representing cities, partitioned into subtours by inserting negative integers.]
- [The tours are to be optimized for the lowest total travel distance or cost.]
- [Each tour in the output should start and end at the assigned depot for that robot.]
- [The genetic algorithm involves steps of initial population generation, crossover, mutation, and parent selection followed by evaluation until a stopping criteria is met.]
- [Output should present the tours for each robot and the total travel cost for each tour as well as the combined overall total travel cost.]
