- [There are 16 cities with specific coordinates provided, including 8 designated as depots.]
- [There are 8 robots, all starting from depot city 0.]
- [Robots can travel between any two cities, with travel cost calculated as the Euclidean distance between cities.]
- [Each robot must visit all cities exactly once, but they do not need to return to the depot after completing their tour.]
- [The tours must start from a designated depot and can end at any city.]
- [The goal is to minimize the total travel cost for all robots combined while ensuring that each city is visited exactly once.]
- [The output should list tours for each robot starting and ending at its assigned depot, provide the travel cost for each tour, and the overall total travel cost.]
