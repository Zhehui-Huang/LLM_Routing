- [There are 16 cities and their coordinates are provided.]
- [There are 8 robots, all starting from depot city 0.]
- [Robots can travel between any two cities, and the travel cost is determined by the Euclidean distance between these cities.]
- [Each robot needs to collectively visit all cities exactly once.]
- [Each robot starts from a designated depot but does not need to return to the depot after completing its tour.]
- [The goal is to determine the shortest tours for each robot while minimizing the total travel cost for all robots combined.]
- [The solution should involve optimizing the total travel distance or cost.]
- [Each city is visited exactly once and tours are optimized for the lowest total travel cost.]
- [Output the tours for each robot as a list of city indices, making sure each tour both starts and ends at a designated depot.]
- [Output the total travel cost for each tour and the overall total travel cost.]
