- [There are 16 cities, each represented with coordinates.]
- [There are 8 robots, starting their journey from depot city 0.]
- [Robots can travel between any two cities.]
- [Travel cost between cities is calculated using the Euclidean distance.]
- [Robots are required to visit each city exactly once and do not need to return to the starting depot.]
- [The goal is to minimize the total travel cost for all robots combined while ensuring each city is visited precisely once.]
- [Chromosomes in the genetic algorithm represent tours and are structured as permutations of city indices with partitioning for robot tours.]
- [The genetic algorithm involves crossover, mutation, and parent selection to evolve solutions.]
- [Outputs must include detailed tours for each robot starting and ending at a depot, along with the total travel cost for each tour and the overall combined travel cost.]
