- [Each robot starts from a designated depot city.]
- [Robots are not required to return to the depot after completing their tour.]
- [Each city must be visited exactly once by some robot.]
- [Optimize the tours for each robot to minimize the total combined travel cost.]
- [The solution requires using a genetic algorithm with specific operators and parameters as described in the task.]
- [Output should list the tours for each robot starting and ending at their assigned depot.]
- [Output should include the travel cost for each tour and the overall total travel cost.]
