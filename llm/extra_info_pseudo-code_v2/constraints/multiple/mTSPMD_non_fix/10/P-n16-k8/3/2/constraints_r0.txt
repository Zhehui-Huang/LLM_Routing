- [There are 16 cities with specific coordinates, categorized into depots (0-7) and regular cities (8-15).]
- [There are 8 robots, all starting at depot city 0.]
- [Robots can travel between any two cities.]
- [Travel cost is the Euclidean distance between two cities.]
- [Each robot must visit all cities exactly once, collectively ensuring every city is visited exactly once.]
- [Each robot starts its tour at a designated depot and can stop at any city; they do not need to return to the start depot.]
- [The objective is to minimize the total travel cost for all robots combined, keeping each city visit unique across all tours.]
- [Output should list tours for each robot starting and ending at its assigned depot, total travel cost for each tour, and the overall total travel cost.]
