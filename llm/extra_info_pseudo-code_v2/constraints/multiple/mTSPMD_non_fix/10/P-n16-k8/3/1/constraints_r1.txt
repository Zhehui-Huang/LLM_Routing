- [There are 16 cities, each with specified coordinates.]
- [There are 8 robots, all starting at depot city 0.]
- [Robots can travel between any two cities.]
- [Travel cost is the Euclidean distance between two cities.]
- [Every city must be visited exactly once by the robots collectively.]
- [Each robot starts from a designated depot and does not need to return after completing its tour.]
- [The goal is to minimize the total travel cost for all robots combined, optimizing the tours for shortest distance.]
- [Chromosome representation involves a permutation of integers representing cities, partitioned into subtours by inserting negative integers for depot transitions.]
- [Initial population of chromosomes is generated randomly, ensuring feasibility with at least one city per tour.]
- [Modified 2-point crossover is used for generating offspring from parent chromosomes.]
- [Mutation operations include moving a city to another tour, swapping two cities between tours, and swapping two cities within the same tour.]
- [Parent selection strategies include elitism, roulette wheel selection, and binary tournament.]
- [The genetic algorithm uses parameters like maximum generations, minimum diversity, population size, and rates for crossover, mutation, and reproduction.]
- [The process involves initializing, generating an initial population, and iterating through selection, crossover, mutation, and replacement to evolve the population until a stopping criterion is met.]
- [Stopping criteria are reaching a maximum number of generations or a diversity threshold.]
- [Output must list the tour for each robot starting and ending at its assigned depot, the total travel cost for each tour, and the overall total travel cost.]
