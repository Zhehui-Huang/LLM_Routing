- [There are 16 cities and their specific coordinates are provided.]
- [There are 8 robots, and all robots start at depot city 0.]
- [Robots can travel between any two cities.]
- [Travel cost is calculated as the Euclidean distance between two cities.]
- [Robots do not need to return to the depot after completing their tour.]
- [Each city must be visited exactly once by any robot.]
- [The goal is to minimize the total travel cost for all robots combined.]
- [Chromosome representation consists of a permutation of the cities, interspersed with negative integers for depots.]
- [Initial chromosomes are generated randomly, ensuring at least one city per tour.]
- [Crossover is performed using a modified 2-point technique with various offspring generation methods.]
- [Mutation involves moving cities between tours or swapping them within/between tours.]
- [Parent selection strategies include Elitism, Roulette Wheel, and Binary Tournament.]
- [The genetic algorithm iterates with parameters for generations, diversity, population size, and rates for crossover, mutation, and reproduction.]
- [Output must display tours and travel costs for each robot, start from their designated depot, and provide an aggregated cost for all tours.]
