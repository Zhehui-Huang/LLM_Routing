- [There are 22 cities, including 4 depots and 18 regular cities.]
- [Cities have specific coordinates provided.]
- [There are 4 robots, each identified by an ID starting from 0.]
- [All robots start at the same initial location, Depot city 0.]
- [Robots can travel between any two cities.]
- [Travel cost is determined by the Euclidean distance between cities.]
- [The task is to ensure each city is visited exactly once by any of the robots.]
- [Each robot starts from and ends at any city; they are not required to return to the initial depot.]
- [The goal is to achieve the shortest possible tours for each robot while minimizing the total combined travel cost.]
- [The solution should be represented as tours, each starting and ending at a designated depot and presenting the total cost for each tour and the overall combined cost.]
