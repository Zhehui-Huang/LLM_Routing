- [There are a total of 22 cities with specified coordinates, including 4 depots and 18 regular cities.]
- [There are 4 robots, all starting from depot city 0.]
- [The travel capability of robots allows them to move between any two cities.]
- [Travel cost is calculated as the Euclidean distance between two cities.]
- [Each robot must visit all cities exactly once collectively among them.]
- [Robots can start at a designated depot and end their tour at any city.]
- [The aim is to minimize the total travel cost for all robots combined.]
- [Chromosomes in the genetic algorithm are permutations of city indices, partitioned into subtours by inserting negative integers to indicate transitions to depots.]
- [The genetic algorithm includes operations such as crossover, mutation, and employs strategies for parent selection like elitism, roulette wheel, and binary tournament.]
- [Output must list tours for each robot starting and ending at its assigned depot and include the travel cost for each tour, as well as an overall total travel cost.]
