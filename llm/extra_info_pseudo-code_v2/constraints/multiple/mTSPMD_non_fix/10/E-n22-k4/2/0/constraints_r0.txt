- [There are 22 cities with specified coordinates.]
- [The robots begin their journey from starting depots (four depot cities numbered from 0 to 3).]
- [Travel cost between any two cities is determined by the Euclidean distance.]
- [All robots start at depot city 0 and can end their tour at any city.]
- [Each robot must visit each city exactly once.]
- [The objective is to minimize the total travel cost for all robots combined.]
- [The solution involves using a genetic algorithm with specified operators and selection strategies.]
- [The chromosome representation includes city indices and negative numbers representing depot transitions.]
- [The genetic algorithm employs elitism, roulette wheel, and binary tournament selection strategies.]
- [Crossover and mutation operations are specified to ensure diversity and optimization in the solution.]
- [The initial population, as well as crossover and mutation, are critical in determining feasible tours.]
- [The output should list each robot's tour beginning and ending at a designated depot, along with the travel cost for each tour and the total cost for all tours.]
