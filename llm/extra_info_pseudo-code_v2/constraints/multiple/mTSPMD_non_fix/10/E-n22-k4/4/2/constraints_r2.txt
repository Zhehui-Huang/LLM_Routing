- [There are 22 cities with specific coordinates, including 4 depots.]
- [Four robots are available, all starting from Depot city 0.]
- [Travel cost is determined by the Euclidean distance between cities.]
- [Each robot must visit each city exactly once, and each city must be visited precisely once by any one of the robots.]
- [Robots do not need to return to the depot after completing their tour.]
- [The aim is to minimize the total travel cost for all robots combined.]
- [Use a genetic algorithm for solving with the provided specific genetic operators and selection strategies.]
- [Output the tours for each robot, starting and ending at their assigned depots.]
- [Output the total travel cost for each tour and the combined total travel cost for all tours.]
