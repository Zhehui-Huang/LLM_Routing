- [Environment has 19 cities with specified coordinates.]
- [There are 2 robots, both starting from the depot city 0.]
- [Robots can travel between any two cities.]
- [Travel cost is calculated using the Euclidean distance between cities.]
- [Robots need to collectively visit all cities exactly once, each city exactly once.]
- [Each robot starts from a designated depot but does not need to return after the tour.]
- [The goal is to minimize the total travel cost for all robots combined.]
- [Output should detail the tours for each robot with city indices and total travel costs.]
- [The overall total travel cost for all tours combined should be provided.]
