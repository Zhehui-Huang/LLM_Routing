- [There are 19 cities, including two depot cities.]
- [Each robot starts from depot city 0.]
- [Travel cost is the Euclidean distance between any two cities.]
- [The robots need to collectively visit all cities exactly once.]
- [Each robot does not need to return to the depot after completing its tour.]
- [The goal is for the robots to have the shortest possible tours while minimizing the combined total travel cost.]
- [Each chromosome in the genetic algorithm is a permutation of city indices, partitioned into subtours by inserting negative integers representing depot transitions.]
- [Chromosomes are generated randomly, ensuring feasibility with at least one city per tour.]
- [A modified 2-point crossover genetic operator is used for generating offspring chromosomes.]
- [Mutation operators include 1-bit (movement), 2-opt (inter-tour swap), and intra-2-opt (intra-tour swap).]
- [Parent selection strategies include elitism, roulette wheel, and binary tournament.]
- [The genetic algorithm runs for a specified maximum number of generations or stops if diversity is below a minimum threshold.]
- [Output should list tours for each robot beginning and ending at its respective depot, along with the total travel cost for each tour and the combined travel cost for all robots.]
