- [There are 19 cities with specified coordinates, including two depot cities.]
- [There are 2 robots, both starting their journey from depot city 0.]
- [Robots can travel between any two cities.]
- [Travel cost is calculated as the Euclidean distance between two cities.]
- [The objective is for the robots to collectively visit all cities exactly once.]
- [Each robot starts from a designated depot but does not need to return to the depot after completing its tour.]
- [The robots can stop at any city as their endpoint.]
- [The goal is to minimize the total travel cost for all robots combined.]
- [The solution should optimize the tours for the lowest total travel distance or cost.]
- [The tour for each robot should be represented as a list of city indices, starting and ending at its assigned depot.]
- [The output should include the total travel cost for each tour and the overall total travel cost.]
