- [Constraint 1] There are 19 cities, including 2 depot cities and 17 other cities, each defined by unique coordinates.
- [Constraint 2] There are 2 robots available for the task.
- [Constraint 3] All robots start their journey at depot city 0.
- [Constraint 4] Travel cost between two cities is calculated using the Euclidean distance formula.
- [Constraint 5] Each robot must visit each city exactly once, excluding the starting depot city, which could be visited more than once as a starting and ending point.
- [Constraint 6] Tours do not have to end at the starting depot; instead, they can end at any city.
- [Constraint 7] The objective is to minimize the total combined travel cost of the robots.
- [Constraint 8] Each chromosome in the genetic algorithm represents a solution as a permutation of city indices, with additional markers (-1, -2, etc.) to denote transitions between depots.
- [Constraint 9] The genetic algorithm uses a modified 2-point crossover method to generate offspring.
- [Constraint 10] Mutation operations include the movement of a city to another tour or swaps within or between tours.
- [Constraint 11] Parent selection strategies include elitism, roulette wheel selection, and binary tournament selection.
- [Constraint 12] The genetic algorithm has parameters for number of generations, minimum diversity, population size, and rates for crossover, mutation, and reproduction.
- [Constraint 13] The genetic algorithm's progression is controlled by the maximum number of generations or a minimum diversity threshold.
- [Constraint 14] The final output must present the tour of each robot as a list of city indices and must specify the total travel cost for each tour and the overall combined cost.
