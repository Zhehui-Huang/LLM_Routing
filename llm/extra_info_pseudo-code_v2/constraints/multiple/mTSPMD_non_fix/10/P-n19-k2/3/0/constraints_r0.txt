- [There are 19 cities, including two depots.]
- [Cities are represented with coordinates, totaling 19 specified points.]
- [There are 2 robots available for the task.]
- [All robots start at depot city 0 at the beginning of their tours.]
- [Robots can travel between any two cities.]
- [Travel costs between cities are calculated based on Euclidean distances.]
- [Each robot starts from a designated depot city but does not need to return to the depot after completing its tour.]
- [The goal is to collectively visit all cities exactly once, and each tour must start at a depot.]
- [The task aims to minimize the total travel cost for all robots combined.]
- [The solution requires defining tours for each robot and calculating travel costs for each tour and the total combined cost.]
- [Output should list tours and costs per robot, starting and ending at their respective depots, and the overall total travel cost.]
