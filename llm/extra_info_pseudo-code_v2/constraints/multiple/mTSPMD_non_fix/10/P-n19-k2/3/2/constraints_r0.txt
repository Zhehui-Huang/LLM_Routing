- [There are 19 cities with specified coordinates, including two depot cities.]
- [Two robots are used for the task, both starting from depot city 0.]
- [Travel cost between cities is determined by the Euclidean distance.]
- [Each robot should visit all cities exactly once collectively, starting from the designated depot.]
- [Robots do not need to return to the depot after completing their tour.]
- [The objective is to minimize the total travel cost for all robots combined while visiting each city once.]
- [Genetic algorithm approach: chromosome representation is a permutation of cities with depot transitions marked by negative integers.]
- [Genetic algorithm operations include initial population generation, modified 2-point crossover, mutation (1-bit, 2-opt, intra-2-opt), and parent selection (elitism, roulette wheel, binary tournament).]
- [Algorithm parameters: Maximum generations (G_max), minimum diversity (sigma_min), population size (pop_size), crossover rate (cr), mutation rate (mr), reproduction rate (rr).]
- [Output format: List the tours for each robot with the starting and ending city being the assigned depot, and provide the total cost for each tour and overall.]
