- [There are 19 cities with specific coordinates from Depot city 0 to City 18.]
- [There are 2 robots, and both start from Depot city 0.]
- [All robots can travel between any two cities.]
- [Travel cost is calculated using the Euclidean distance between two cities.]
- [Robots need to visit all cities exactly once.]
- [Each robot starts from a designated depot but does not necessarily have to return to the depot after completing its tour.]
- [The objective is to determine the shortest tours for each robot while minimizing the total travel cost for both robots combined.]
- [Cities need to be represented by integer indices in the robots' tours.]
- [Chromosomes in the genetic algorithm are permutations of the integers representing cities, partitioned into subtours by inserting negative integers.]
- [The tours must be optimized for the lowest combined travel distance or cost, ensuring that each city is visited exactly once.]
- [Output should include the tour for each robot starting and ending at its assigned depot, the travel cost for each tour, and the overall total travel cost.]
