- [There are 21 cities, each identified by an index from 0 to 20, with specific Cartesian coordinates provided for each city.]
- [There are 2 robots, both starting from depot city 0.]
- [Travel cost between cities is calculated using the Euclidean distance formula.]
- [Robots are tasked with visiting all cities exactly once collectively, but each robot does not necessarily visit every city.]
- [Each city is to be visited exactly once across all robots.]
- [Robots can finish their tour in any city, not necessarily in a depot city.]
- [The goal is to determine the shortest possible tours for each robot while minimizing the combined total travel cost for all robots.]
- [Output should include a list of tours for each robot, starting and ending at the designated deports, and should specify the travel cost for each tour as well as the overall travel cost.]
- [A genetic algorithm approach, described with specific genetic operations such as chromosome representation, crossover, mutation, and parent selection strategy, will be used to solve this VRP variant.]
