- [There are 21 cities including 2 depot cities.]
- [Cities are indexed from 0 to 20, with city 0 and city 1 serving as depots.]
- [There are 2 robots starting from depot city 0.]
- [Robots can travel between any two cities.]
- [Travel cost is calculated as the Euclidean distance between cities.]
- [Robots need to collectively visit all cities exactly once.]
- [Each robot starts from a designated depot and does not need to return to the depot.]
- [The goal is to minimize the total travel cost for all robots combined while ensuring each city is visited exactly once.]
- [Chromosome representation includes a permutation of city indices, partitioned into tours by inserting negative integers for depot transitions.]
- [Initial population generation involves random permutations of cities with inserted negative integers to designate depots.]
- [Crossover is a modified 2-point type designed to maintain valid tours and prevent city repeats.]
- [Mutation operators include moving a city to another tour and swapping cities either between or within tours.]
- [Parent selection strategies include Elitism, Roulette Wheel, and Binary Tournament.]
- [The genetic algorithm employs parameters like maximum generations, minimum diversity, population size, and rates for crossover, mutation, and reproduction.]
- [Stopping criteria for the algorithm are based on maximum generations or minimum diversity.]
- [The output requires listing the tours for each robot starting and ending at their assigned depot, and the total travel cost for each tour along with the overall total cost.]
