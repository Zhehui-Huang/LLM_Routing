- [There are 21 cities including 2 depot cities.]
- [Cities are indexed from 0 to 20.]
- [Number of robots: 2, both start at depot city 0, indexed as robot 0 and robot 1.]
- [Robots can travel between any two cities.]
- [Travel cost is calculated using the Euclidean distance between cities.]
- [The algorithm to solve the problem is a genetic algorithm with specific strategies for chromosome representation, initial population, crossover, mutation, and parent selection.]
- [Each robot's tour should start at depot city 0 and can end at any city (does not need to return to the depot).]
- [Each city must be visited exactly once by any robot, with no city visited by more than one robot.]
- [The objective is to minimize the total travel cost across all robots.]
- [Output should include separate tours for each robot starting and potentially ending at their assigned depot, the travel cost for each tour, and the total combined travel cost of all tours.]
