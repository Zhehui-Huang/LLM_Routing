- [There are 21 cities, including 2 depot cities.]
- [Cities are identified by integers where depot city 0 is at coordinates (30, 40) and depot city 1 is at (37, 52).]
- [There are 2 robots, each starting from depot city 0.]
- [Robots can travel between any two cities.]
- [Travel cost is the Euclidean distance between the cities.]
- [Each robot needs to visit every city exactly once collectively among all robots.]
- [Each robot starts its route from the designated depot but does not need to return to the depot after completing its tour.]
- [The goal is to minimize the total travel cost for all robots combined while ensuring each city is visited exactly once by any robot.]
- [Output the tours for each robot, starting and ending at its assigned depot.]
- [Output the total travel cost for each robot's tour and the overall total travel cost.]
