- [There are a total of 21 cities, including 2 depot cities.]
- [Cities are indexed from 0 to 20, with city 0 and city 1 being depots.]
- [There are 2 robots, both starting at depot city 0.]
- [Each robot must visit all cities exactly once, collectively covering all cities without overlaps in visits.]
- [Robots do not need to return to a depot city after completing their tours.]
- [Tours can end at any city.]
- [Travel cost between cities is calculated using the Euclidean distance formula.]
- [The goal is to minimize the total travel cost for all robots combined.]
- [Chromosomes represent solutions and include a permutation of city indices with added negative numbers indicating depot transitions.]
- [Use genetic algorithm techniques including chromosome representation, initial population, crossover, mutation, and parent selection strategies as described.]
- [Output must include the tour for each robot starting and ending at its assigned depot and list the travel cost for each tour plus the overall total travel cost.]
