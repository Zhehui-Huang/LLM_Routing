- [There are 21 cities including two depot cities.]
- [Each robot starts at depot city 0.]
- [Travel cost is calculated using the Euclidean distance between two cities.]
- [Robots need to visit all cities exactly once collectively.]
- [Tours for robots are to begin from a designated depot and do not need to return to the depot after the tour completion.]
- [The goal is to minimize the total travel cost for all robots combined.]
- [Output should list tours for each robot starting and ending at its assigned depot, include total travel cost for each tour, and overall total travel cost.]
