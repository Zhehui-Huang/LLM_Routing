- [There are 21 cities, mapped with specific coordinates.]
- [Two robots available, both starting from depot city 0 and capable of traveling between any two cities.]
- [Travel cost is calculated via Euclidean distance between city coordinates.]
- [Robots need to visit all cities exactly once and can stop at any city as their endpoint.]
- [The objective is to minimize the total travel cost for all robots combined.]
- [Each robot's tour should start from a designated depot and does not need to return to the depot after completing its tour.]
- [Output should clearly list the cities in the tour for each robot, the travel cost for each tour, and the combined total travel cost.]
- [The genetic algorithm uses a special chromosome representation where each chromosome is a permutation of integer city identifiers and depot transitions.]
- [Initial population is generated randomly ensuring feasibility with proper depot insertions.]
- [The crossover strategy is a modified 2-point crossover that avoids repeated cities in the chromosome.]
- [Mutation operators used include moving a city to another tour, swapping two cities between tours, and swapping within the same tour.]
- [Parent selection strategies include Elitism, Roulette Wheel, and Binary Tournament.]
- [The algorithm parameters consist of maximum generations, minimum diversity, population size, crossover rate, mutation rate, and reproduction rate.]
- [Algorithm stopping conditions are based on the maximum generation count or when diversity is below a preset threshold.]
