- [There are 21 cities with specified coordinates, including 2 depot cities.]
- [There are 2 robots that start from depot city 0.]
- [Robots can travel between any two cities.]
- [Travel cost is calculated using the Euclidean distance between two cities.]
- [Each city must be visited exactly once by the robots collectively.]
- [Robots can stop at any city; they do not need to return to the depot.]
- [The goal is to find the shortest tours for each robot while minimizing the total travel cost for all robots combined.]
- [The solution should be derived using a genetic algorithm with stipulated parameters and procedures including chromosome representation, initial population generation, crossover, mutation, and parent selection strategies.]
- [The tours for each robot should be presented as lists of city indices, starting and ending at the assigned depots.]
- [The output should include the total travel cost for each tour and the overall total travel cost.]
