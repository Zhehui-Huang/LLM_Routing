- [There are 15 cities, including the depot.]
- [Cities are grouped into 5 sets. Each set contains exactly 3 cities.]
- [The robot starts and ends its journey at the depot city (City 0).]
- [The robot must visit exactly one city from each group.]
- [Travel costs between cities are based on the Euclidean distance between them.]
- [The task is to find the shortest possible tour that satisfies the previous constraints.]
- [The solution should be provided as a list of city indices representing the tour, starting and ending at the depot city.]
- [The solution should also include the total travel cost of the tour.]
