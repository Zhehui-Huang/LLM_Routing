- [There are 15 cities, including the depot city labeled as 0.]
- [Depot city 0 coordinates are (54, 87). Other city coordinates are provided in the task.]
- [Cities are organized into 5 groups, each group containing specific cities.]
- [One robot starts at the depot city 0 and must travel between cities.]
- [The robot can travel between any two cities.]
- [Travel cost between any two cities is calculated as the Euclidean distance between them.]
- [The robot must visit exactly one city from each group of cities.]
- [The robot must start and end the tour at the depot city 0.]
- [The objective is to find the shortest possible tour meeting the above requirements and visit restrictions.]
- [Output the shortest tour as a list of city indices starting and ending at city 0.]
- [Output the total travel cost of the tour.]
