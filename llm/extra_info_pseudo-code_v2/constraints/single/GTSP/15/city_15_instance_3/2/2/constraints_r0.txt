- [The robot needs to start and end the journey at Depot city 0.]
- [The robot is required to visit exactly one city from each of the six city groups.]
- [Travel cost is calculated using the Euclidean distance between cities.]
- [The solution must find the shortest possible tour for the robot.]
- [The output format must list the tour starting and ending at city 0 and provide the total cost.]
- [There are 15 cities in total including the depot.]
- [Each city's location is given by its coordinates.]
- [Cities are organized into six groups.]
- [The algorithm must handle a generalized Traveling Salesman Problem variant where visiting at least one city from each group is mandatory.]
