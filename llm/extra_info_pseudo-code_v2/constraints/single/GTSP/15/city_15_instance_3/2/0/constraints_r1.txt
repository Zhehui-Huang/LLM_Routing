- [The environment consists of 15 cities, including the depot city 0.]
- [Each city is represented by a unique integer identifier ranging from 0 to 14 and is associated with specific coordinates.]
- [City groups are defined, with each group containing a distinct subset of the total cities.]
- [The robot must travel starting and ending at the depot city 0.]
- [The robot must visit exactly one city from each group of cities.]
- [Travel between cities is unrestricted, and the robot can travel between any two cities.]
- [Travel cost between two cities is calculated as the Euclidean distance between their coordinates.]
- [The task is to determine the shortest possible tour that satisfies the city and routing constraints.]
- [The tour output must include the sequence of city indices, starting and ending at the depot city 0.]
- [The total travel cost of the tour must be provided in the output.]
