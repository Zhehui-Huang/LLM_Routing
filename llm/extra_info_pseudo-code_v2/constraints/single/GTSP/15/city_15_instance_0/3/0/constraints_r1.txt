- [There are 15 cities including the depot city 0.]
- [Depot city 0 is located at coordinates (9, 93).]
- [Cities have specific coordinates ranging between (x, y) where x and y can be between 3 to 88 for x and 21 to 99 for y.]
- [There are 3 city groups: Group 0:[2, 7, 10, 11, 14], Group 1:[1, 3, 5, 8, 13], Group 2:[4, 6, 9, 12].]
- [There is one robot.]
- [The robot starts at depot city 0.]
- [The robot can travel between any two cities.]
- [Travel cost is calculated as the Euclidean distance between two cities.]
- [The robot needs to visit exactly one city from each city group.]
- [The tour should start and end at the depot city 0.]
- [The shortest tour is required.]
- [The task is solved using the GLNS (Generalized Large Neighborhood Search) algorithm or similar method specialized to the GTSP problem.]
- [The output should include the list of city indices of the tour starting and ending at the depot city 0.]
- [The output should also include the total travel cost of the tour.]
