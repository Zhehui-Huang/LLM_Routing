- [The environment consists of 15 cities including the depot.]
- [Depot city is indexed at 0 with coordinates (9, 93).]
- [Each city has a unique index and specific coordinates provided.]
- [Cities are divided into 3 groups: Group 0, Group 1, and Group 2.]
- [The robot must visit exactly one city from each group.]
- [The robot starts and ends its journey at the depot city.]
- [Travel cost is calculated using the Euclidean distance between two cities.]
- [One robot is available for completing the task.]
- [Output should be in the form of a list starting and ending with the depot city index, including the total travel cost.]
- [The main task is to find the shortest tour wherein the robot visits all specified cities exactly once, adhering to group visitation requirements.]
