- [There are 15 cities, each identified with a corresponding coordinate pair.]
- [City groups are defined: Group 0 (1, 2, 5, 6), Group 1 (8, 9, 10, 13), Group 2 (3, 4, 7), and Group 3 (11, 12, 14).]
- [The robot starts and ends its route at the depot city 0.]
- [The robot must visit exactly one city from each group.]
- [Travel cost is calculated using the Euclidean distance between two cities.]
- [The solution must be represented as a tour sequence starting and ending at the depot city 0, followed by the total travel cost.]
