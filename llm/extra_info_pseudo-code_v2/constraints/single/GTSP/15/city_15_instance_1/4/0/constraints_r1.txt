- [There are 15 cities including the depot city, city indices range from 0 to 14.]
- [The robot starts and ends its tour at the depot city, which is city 0.]
- [The robot needs to visit exactly one city from each of the 4 groups of cities during its tour.]
- [Travel cost between any two cities is calculated using the Euclidean distance formula.]
- [City coordinates are given for each city, including the depot city.]
- [Group 0 includes cities: 1, 2, 5, 6.]
- [Group 1 includes cities: 8, 9, 10, 13.]
- [Group 2 includes cities: 3, 4, 7.]
- [Group 3 includes cities: 11, 12, 14.]
