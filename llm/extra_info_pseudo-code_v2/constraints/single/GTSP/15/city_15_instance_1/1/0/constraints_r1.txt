- [The environment consists of a depot city (City 0) and 14 other cities, making a total of 15 cities.]
- [Cities are divided into 4 groups; each group contains a specific set of city indices.]
- [A single robot starts the tour at the depot city and must return to the depot city at the end of the tour.]
- [The robot must visit exactly one city from each group in the course of its tour.]
- [The travel cost between any two cities is calculated using the Euclidean distance formula.]
- [The goal is to find the shortest possible tour that meets the above requirements.]
