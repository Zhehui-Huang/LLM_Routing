- [There are 10 cities, each represented by a coordinate pair.]
- [There is one depot city labeled as City 0 with coordinates (90, 3).]
- [There are 5 groups of cities, and the robot needs to visit exactly one city from each group.]
- [The robot starts and ends its journey at the depot city (City 0).]
- [Travel cost between two cities is calculated using the Euclidean distance formula.]
- [The total route should be the shortest possible that visits one city from each group and returns to the starting point.]
