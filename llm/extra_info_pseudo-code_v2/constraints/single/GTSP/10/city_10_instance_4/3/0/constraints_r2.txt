- [There are 10 cities with specified coordinates.]
- [Cities are grouped into 7 groups, and from each group, exactly one city must be visited.]
- [A single robot is available which starts and ends its tour at the depot city (city 0).]
- [Travel costs are calculated using the Euclidean distance between cities.]
- [The robot must complete a tour starting and ending at the depot city, visiting exactly one city from each group in between.]
- [The objective is to find the shortest possible tour satisfying the above constraints.]
