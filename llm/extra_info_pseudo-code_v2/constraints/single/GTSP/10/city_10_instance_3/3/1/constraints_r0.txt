- [The environment consists of 10 cities with specified coordinates.]
- [There is one depot city (city 0).]
- [Cities are grouped into 6 groups with specified cities within each group.]
- [There is one robot which starts and ends at the depot city.]
- [Robot travel cost is determined by the Euclidean distance between cities.]
- [The robot must visit exactly one city from each group of cities.]
- [The shortest tour for the robot is required, starting and ending at the depot city.]
- [The Tour and the total travel cost of the tour should be output, with the tour starting and ending at the depot city.]
- [The given task must utilize the pseudocode provided for the GLS Algorithm to determine the solution.]
