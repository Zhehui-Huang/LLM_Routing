- [There are 10 cities, each with specific coordinates.]
- [There is one depot city (City 0) from where the robot starts and ends its tour.]
- [Travel cost between cities is calculated using the Euclidean distance.]
- [All cities are grouped into 6 groups, and the robot needs to visit exactly one city from each group.]
- [The robot must find the shortest possible tour that starts and ends at the depot city, including one city from each group.]
