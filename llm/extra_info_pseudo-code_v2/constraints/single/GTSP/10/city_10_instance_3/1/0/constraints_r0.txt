- [There are 10 cities with the depot city labeled as city 0.]
- [City coordinates are fixed and provided as follows: City 0 (84, 67), City 1 (74, 40), City 2 (71, 13), City 3 (74, 82), City 4 (97, 28), City 5 (0, 31), City 6 (8, 62), City 7 (74, 56), City 8 (85, 71), City 9 (6, 76).]
- [Cities are grouped into 6 groups: Group 0: [7, 9], Group 1: [1, 3], Group 2: [4, 6], Group 3: [8], Group 4: [5], Group 5: [2].]
- [There is one robot starting at the depot city 0.]
- [The robot must visit exactly one city from each group, starting and ending at the depot city.]
- [The robot can travel between any two cities.]
- [The travel cost is calculated as the Euclidean distance between two cities.]
- [The task is to find the shortest tour for the robot.]
- [The output should include the tour as a list of city indices beginning and ending at the depot city 0.]
- [The output should also include the total travel cost of the tour.]
