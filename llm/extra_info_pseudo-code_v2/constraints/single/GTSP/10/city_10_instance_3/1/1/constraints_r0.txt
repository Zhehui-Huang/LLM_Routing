- [There are 10 cities with specified coordinates.]
- [City indices range from 0 (depot city) to 9.]
- [There is one robot starting at the depot city 0.]
- [The robot can travel between any two cities.]
- [Travel cost is calculated as the Euclidean distance between any two cities.]
- [There are 6 groups of cities, each requiring exactly one visit from the robot.]
- [Groups contain varying numbers of cities, specified as follows: Group 0: [7, 9], Group 1: [1, 3], Group 2: [4, 6], Group 3: [8], Group 4: [5], Group 5: [5].]
- [The robot's tour must start and end at the depot city (city 0).]
- [The task requires finding the shortest tour that includes visiting one city from each group and returning to the depot city.]
- [The output should list the tour as a sequence of city indices and the total travel cost. The tour should follow the format: [start city, visit cities, end city].]
