- [The environment contains 10 cities with specified coordinates.]
- [There are 4 groups of cities, and the robot needs to visit exactly one city from each group.]
- [The robot starts and ends its journey at the depot city 0.]
- [The travel cost is the Euclidean distance between two cities.]
- [The solution should implement a variant of the GTSP, specifically using a custom GLNS algorithm as described in the provided pseudo code.]
- [The output should be a list of city indices representing the tour, starting and ending at city 0, and the total travel cost of the tour.]
