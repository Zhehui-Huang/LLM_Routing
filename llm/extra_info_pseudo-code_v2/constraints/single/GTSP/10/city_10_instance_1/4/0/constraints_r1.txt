- [There are 10 cities labeled 0 through 9 with specific coordinates.]
- [Depot city 0 has coordinates (53, 68).]
- [The cities are divided into 4 groups: Group 0 [5, 6, 7], Group 1 [2, 3], Group 2 [1, 9], Group 3 [4, 8].]
- [There is one robot starting at the depot city 0.]
- [The robot can travel between any two cities.]
- [The travel cost is calculated as the Euclidean distance between the two cities.]
- [The robot needs to visit exactly one city from each group, starting and ending at the depot city.]
- [The solution should find the shortest tour for the robot.]
- [The solution should use the pseudocode provided for the GLNS algorithm.]
- [Output the tour as a list of city indices starting and ending at the depot city 0.]
- [Output the total travel cost of the tour.]
