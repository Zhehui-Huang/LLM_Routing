- [There are 10 cities with specified coordinates.]
- [City groups are defined, and the robot must visit exactly one city from each group.]
- [The robot starts and ends its journey at the depot city, which is city 0.]
- [The travel cost is calculated based on the Euclidean distance between cities.]
- [The goal is to find the shortest possible tour that adheres to the group restrictions.]
- [Output should include both the complete tour as a list of city indices starting and ending at city 0, and the total travel cost.]
- [Implement and solve the problem using a Generalized Large Neighborhood Search (GLNS) algorithm according to the provided pseudocode.]
