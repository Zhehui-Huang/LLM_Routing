- The robot needs to start and end its tour at the depot city which is city 0.
- The robot can travel between any two cities, and the travel cost is the Euclidean distance between them.
- The robot must visit exactly one city from each group of cities. There are three groups with cities assigned as follows: Group 0: [1, 2, 6], Group 1: [3, 7, 8], Group 2: [4, 5, 9].
- The output should list the tour as a sequence of city indices, starting and ending at city 0.
- The output also needs to include the total travel cost of the tour.
