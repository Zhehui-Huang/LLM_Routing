- [There are 10 cities labeled from 0 to 9, with depot city at index 0.]
- [City coordinates: Depot city 0: (50, 42), City 1: (41, 1), City 2: (18, 46), City 3: (40, 98), City 4: (51, 69), City 5: (47, 39), City 6: (62, 26), City 7: (79, 31), City 8: (61, 90), City 9: (42, 49).]
- [There are 3 city groups: Group 0: [1, 2, 6], Group 1: [3, 7, 8], Group 2: [4, 5, 9].]
- [There is one robot starting at the depot city 0.]
- [The robot must visit exactly one city from each city group, starting and ending at the depot city.]
- [Travel cost between any two cities is calculated as the Euclidean distance.]
- [The robot's task is to find the shortest tour visiting one city per group and returning to the depot.]
- [Output the tour as a list of city indices starting and ending at the depot city.]
- [Output the total travel cost of the tour.]
