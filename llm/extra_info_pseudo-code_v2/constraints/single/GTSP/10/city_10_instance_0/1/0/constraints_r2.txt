- [There are 10 specified cities with distinct coordinates.]
- [City indices are grouped into three groups: Group 0: [1, 2, 6], Group 1: [3, 7, 8], Group 2: [4, 5, 9].]
- [One robot starts and ends its route at the depot city 0.]
- [The robot must visit exactly one city from each group, forming a tour, which must be minimal in travel distance.]
- [The travel cost between any two cities is determined by the Euclidean distance.]
- [The tour should be given as a list of city indices starting and ending at city 0.]
- [Output should also specify the total travel cost of the tour.]
