- [There are 5 groups of cities, and exactly one city from each group must be visited by the robot.]
- [The robot starts and ends its tour at the depot city, which is city 0.]
- [Travel cost between cities is calculated using the Euclidean distance.]
- [There is a single robot available for completing the tour.]
- [The task is to find the shortest possible tour that visits one city from each city group, starting and ending at the depot city.]
- [Output the tour as a list of city indices, starting and ending at the depot city.]
- [Output the total travel cost of the tour.]
