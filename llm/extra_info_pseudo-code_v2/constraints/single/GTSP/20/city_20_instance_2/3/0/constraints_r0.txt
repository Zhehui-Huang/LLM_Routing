- [There are 20 cities, including the depot city.]
- [Depot city is city 0 with coordinates (3, 26).]
- [Robot starts and ends the trip at the depot city 0.]
- [Robot needs to visit exactly one city from each city group.]
- [There are 5 city groups: Group 0: [7, 10, 11, 12], Group 1: [3, 8, 13, 16], Group 2: [2, 4, 15, 18], Group 3: [1, 9, 14, 19], Group 4: [5, 6, 17].]
- [Travel cost between any two cities is computed using the Euclidean distance.]
- [The robot can travel between any two cities.]
- [The task is to find the shortest tour that satisfies the travel requirements.]
- [Output should list the tour as a sequence of city indices starting and ending at the depot city 0.]
- [Output should also list the total travel cost of the tour.]
