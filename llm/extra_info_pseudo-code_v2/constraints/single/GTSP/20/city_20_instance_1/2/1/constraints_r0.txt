- [There are 20 cities, listed by their indices from 0 to 19, with specified coordinates.]
- [The robot must start and end its journey at the depot city, which is city 0.]
- [The robot must visit exactly one city from each of four specific groups of cities.]
- [Travel cost between two cities is calculated using the Euclidean distance.]
- [The goal is to compute the shortest possible tour that meets the above constraints.]
- [Output the tour as a list of city indices, starting and ending at city 0.]
- [Output the total travel cost of the tour.]
