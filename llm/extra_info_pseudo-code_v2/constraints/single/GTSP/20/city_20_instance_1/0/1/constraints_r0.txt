- [The robot must start and end its tour at the depot city (City 0).]
- [The robot needs to visit exactly one city from each of the four city groups.]
- [Travel cost between cities is calculated using the Euclidean distance.]
- [The solution should minimize the total travel cost of the tour.]
- [The output should be formatted as a list of city indices indicating the route of the tour, beginning and ending at the depot city.]
- [The output should include the total travel cost of the tour.]
