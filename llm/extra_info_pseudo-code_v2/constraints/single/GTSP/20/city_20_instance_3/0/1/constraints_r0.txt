- [The environment contains 20 cities with specific coordinates, including a depot city (city 0).]
- [There are 6 city groups, and from each group exactly one city must be visited by the robot.]
- [The robot starts and ends its tour at the depot city 0.]
- [Travel cost between two cities is calculated based on Euclidean distance.]
- [The robot needs to find the shortest tour that visits one city from each group and returns to the depot.]
- [The tour should be output as a list of city indices starting and ending at city 0.]
- [The total travel cost of the tour should be calculated and displayed.]
