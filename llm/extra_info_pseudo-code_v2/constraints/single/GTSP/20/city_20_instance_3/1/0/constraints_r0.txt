- [The environment consists of 20 cities, each with defined coordinates.]
- [Groups of cities are defined, and one robot starts and ends at the depot city (City 0).]
- [The robot must visit exactly one city from each city group.]
- [The robot can travel between any two cities.]
- [Travel costs are calculated as the Euclidean distance between two cities.]
- [The task is to find the shortest possible tour for the robot.]
- [The tour must start and end at the depot city 0.]
- [GLNS algorithm should be used for solving the Generalized Traveling Salesman Problem (GTSP).]
- [Each trial in the GLNS algorithm involves initializing a tour, iteratively improving it using various heuristics, and terminating based on a stopping criterion.]
- [Updates to heuristic weights are based on their performance.]
- [The output should list the tour as a sequence of city indices and the total travel cost of the tour.]
