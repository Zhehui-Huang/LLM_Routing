- [Requirement 1] There is only one robot, and it always starts and ends the tour at the depot city (0).
- [Requirement 2] The robot must visit all the cities exactly once, aside from the depot city.
- [Requirement 3] The tour's cost should be calculated using the Euclidean distance between cities.
- [Requirement 4] Find the shortest possible tour that satisfies all constraints.
- [Requirement 5] The output should provide both the route of the cities as a list and the total travel cost of that route.
- [Requirement 6] The Lin-Kernighan algorithm should be used to find the solution.
- [Requirement 7] The tour should commence and conclude at city 0.
