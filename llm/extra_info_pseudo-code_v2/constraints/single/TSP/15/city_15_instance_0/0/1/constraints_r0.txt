- [Requirement 1] The tour must start and end at the depot city, which is city 0.
- [Requirement 2] Each city, except the depot city, must be visited exactly once by the robot.
- [Requirement 3] The travel cost between any two cities is calculated using the Euclidean distance.
- [Requirement 4] The output should provide the list of cities in the order they are visited, starting and ending at the depot city, in the form of city indices.
- [Requirement 5] The output should also include the total travel cost of the tour.
- [Requirement 6] The optimization algorithm to be applied is the Lin-Kernighan algorithm.
