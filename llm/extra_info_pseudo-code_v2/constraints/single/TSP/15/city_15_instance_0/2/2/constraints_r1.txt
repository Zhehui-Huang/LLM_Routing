- [The problem involves 15 cities, including the depot.]
- [The depot city is city 0 with coordinates (9, 93).]
- [Cities are identified with coordinates, and there are 14 cities (1-14) in addition to the depot city.]
- [The robot starts at the depot city 0.]
- [The robot can travel between any two cities.]
- [Travel cost between cities is computed using the Euclidean distance.]
- [The robot must visit each city exactly once, excluding the depot city, and then return to the depot city.]
- [The solution should aim to find the shortest possible tour.]
- [Lin-Kernighan algorithm is suggested for finding an improved tour.]
- [Output must be the tour as a list of city indices starting and ending at city 0.]
- [Output must also include the total travel cost of the tour.]
