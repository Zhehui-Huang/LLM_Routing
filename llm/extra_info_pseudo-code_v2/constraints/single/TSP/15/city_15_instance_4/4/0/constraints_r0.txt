- [Requirement 1] There are 15 cities including the depot city, which is city 0 where the robot starts and ends its journey.
- [Requirement 2] The robot must visit all cities exactly once, except for the depot city, before returning to the depot city.
- [Requirement 3] The robot can travel between any two cities, and the travel cost is calculated as the Euclidean distance between these cities.
- [Requirement 4] The robot's tour needs to be the shortest possible that satisfies all the given conditions.
- [Requirement 5] The tour should start and end at depot city 0.
- [Requirement 6] The solution should use the Lin-Kernighan algorithm.
- [Requirement 7] The output should be a list of city indices showing the order of the tour and the total travel cost of this tour.
