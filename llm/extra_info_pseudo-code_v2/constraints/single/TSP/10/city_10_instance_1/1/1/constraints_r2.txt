- [Requirement 1]: The environment consists of 10 cities listed with fixed positions, including the depot city at index 0.
- [Requirement 2]: There is one robot that starts at the depot city (city 0) and must return there after visiting all other cities exactly once.
- [Requirement 3]: Travel costs between any two cities are calculated using the Euclidean distance.
- [Requirement 4]: The shortest possible tour must be calculated that the robot can take to visit all cities exactly once and return to the depot city.
- [Requirement 5]: The output must include the sequence of cities visited in the tour starting and ending at the depot city, along with the total travel cost of that tour.
- [Requirement 6]: The Lin-Kernighan algorithm should be utilized to improve an initial tour into the shortest tour.
