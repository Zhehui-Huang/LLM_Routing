- [Requirement 1] The robot must start and end the tour at the depot city, which is city 0.
- [Requirement 2] The robot must visit all cities exactly once and can travel between any two cities.
- [Requirement 3] Travel cost between cities is calculated using the Euclidean distance.
- [Requirement 4] The task should be approached using the Lin-Kernighan algorithm, which is suitable for optimizing tour routes.
- [Requirement 5] The output should include both the tour as a list of city indices starting and ending at the depot city and the total travel cost of the tour.
