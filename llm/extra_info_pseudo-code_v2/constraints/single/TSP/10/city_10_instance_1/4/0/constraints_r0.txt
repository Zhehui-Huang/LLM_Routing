- [The environment consists of a total of 10 designated cities, including the depot city which is indexed as 0.]
- [Cities coordinates are given explicitly for all the 10 cities.]
- [There is one robot starting its route from the depot city 0.]
- [The robot is required to visit each city exactly once, excluding the depot, then return to the depot city to complete the tour.]
- [Travel cost between any two cities is determined by the Euclidean distance between them.]
- [The objective is to determine the shortest possible tour that the robot can take under the given conditions.]
- [Use of the Lin-Kernighan algorithm is suggested for solving the problem, implying the problem should be tackled with a heuristic targeted at optimizing the tour's path.]
- [The final output should be a list starting and ending at the depot city 0, displaying the sequence of cities in the tour.]
- [The final output should also provide the total travel cost for the complete tour.]
