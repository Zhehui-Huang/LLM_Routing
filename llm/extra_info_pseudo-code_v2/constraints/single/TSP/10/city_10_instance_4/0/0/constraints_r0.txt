- [The robot must start and end the tour at depot city, which is city 0.]
- [The robot must visit all other cities (cities 1 through 9) exactly once.]
- [Travel costs between cities are based on the Euclidean distance.]
- [The goal is to find the shortest possible tour that meets the above constraints.]
- [Output should include the tour as a list of city indices starting and ending at city 0.]
- [Output should also include the total travel cost of the tour.]
