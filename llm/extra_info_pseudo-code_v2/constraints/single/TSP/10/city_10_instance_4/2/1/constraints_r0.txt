- [There are 10 distinct cities, each specified with a unique (x, y) coordinate, where city 0 serves as the depot.]
- [A single robot, starting and ending at the depot (city 0), must visit all other cities exactly once.]
- [The travel cost between any two cities is determined using the Euclidean distance calculation.]
- [The main task is to find the shortest possible tour using the Lin-Kernighan algorithm, as described in the provided pseudocode.]
- [The solution should include the tour as a list of city indices starting and ending at the depot, accompanied by the total travel cost of the tour.]
