- [The environment consists of 10 specific cities, each with defined coordinates.]
- [The depot is city 0, where the robot starts and ends its tour.]
- [There is one robot that needs to visit each city exactly once, except the depot city.]
- [Travel cost between cities is calculated as the Euclidean distance.]
- [The objective is to find the shortest possible tour for the robot starting and ending at the depot.]
- [The Lin-Kernighan algorithm should be implemented to optimize the tour.]
- [Output should be a list indicating the sequence of cities in the tour starting and ending at city 0.]
- [Output should also include the total travel cost of the concluded tour.]
