- [Requirement 1] The robot must start and end its tour at the depot city, which is city 0 with coordinates (84, 67).
- [Requirement 2] The tour must include all other cities exactly once. The cities' coordinates are: City 1: (74, 40), City 2: (71, 13), City 3: (74, 82), City 4: (97, 28), City 5: (0, 31), City 6: (8, 62), City 7: (74, 56), City 8: (85, 71), City 9: (6, 76).
- [Requirement 3] The travel cost between any two cities is calculated using the Euclidean distance.
- [Requirement 4] The output should list the tour as a list of city indices starting and ending at the depot city 0 and include the total travel cost of the tour.
- [Requirement 5] Implement the solution based on the provided Lin-Kernighan algorithm pseudocode.
