- [Requirement 1] The robot must visit all cities exactly once and return to the depot city (total of 20 cities including the depot).
- [Requirement 2] The robot starts and ends the tour at the depot city (city index 0).
- [Requirement 3] The travel cost between any two cities is calculated as the Euclidean distance.
- [Requirement 4] Provide the shortest possible tour given these constraints using the Lin-Kernighan algorithm.
- [Requirement 5] Output the tour as a list of city indices starting and ending at the depot city.
- [Requirement 6] Output the total travel cost of the tour.
