- [Requirement 1] There are 20 cities, including the depot city 0, with identified coordinates.
- [Requirement 2] The robot starts and ends the route at depot city 0.
- [Requirement 3] The robot must visit all cities exactly once, except the depot city.
- [Requirement 4] The travel cost between any two cities is calculated using the Euclidean distance.
- [Requirement 5] The goal is to find the shortest tour possible.
- [Requirement 6] Output should consist of a tour as a list of city indices starting and ending at the depot city.
- [Requirement 7] Output should provide the total travel cost of the tour.
- [Requirement 8] The Lin-Kernighan algorithm is suggested for solving the problem.
