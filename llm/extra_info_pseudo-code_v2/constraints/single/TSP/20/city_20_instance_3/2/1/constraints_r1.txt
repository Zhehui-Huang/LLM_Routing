- [Requirement 1] Robot must start and end the tour at depot city indexed at 0.
- [Requirement 2] Robot must visit every other city exactly once during the tour.
- [Requirement 3] The travel cost between cities is calculated based on the Euclidean distance.
- [Requirement 4] Output should be the list of city indices depicting the tour starting and ending at city 0, and the total travel cost of that tour.
- [Requirement 5] The solution should be based on the Lin-Kernighan algorithm, adapting it to the given city coordinates and task constraints.
