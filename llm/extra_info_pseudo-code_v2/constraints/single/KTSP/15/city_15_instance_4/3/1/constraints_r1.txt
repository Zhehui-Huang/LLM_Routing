- [Requirement 1] The robot must visit exactly 12 cities, including the depot city, starting and ending at the depot city.
- [Requirement 2] The robot can travel between any two cities, and travel cost is calculated as the Euclidean distance between the two cities.

- [Requirement 4] The tour should start and end at the depot city 0.
- [Requirement 5] The solution must be obtained using the General Variable Neighborhood Search (GVNS) algorithm, including its subroutines.
- [Requirement 6] Output should be the tour as a list of city indices and the total travel cost of the tour.
