- [Requirement 1]: The robot must start and end its tour at the depot city, which is city 0.
- [Requirement 2]: The tour must include exactly 12 cities out of the 15 available.
- [Requirement 3]: The goal is to find the shortest possible tour, where the travel cost is calculated as the Euclidean distance between the cities.
- [Requirement 4]: The output should include the tour as a list of city indices, starting and ending at the city 0.
- [Requirement 5]: The output should also include the total travel cost of the tour.
- [Requirement 6]: The solution should be computed using the General Variable Neighborhood Search (GVNS) algorithm along with its subroutines as provided in the pseudocode.
