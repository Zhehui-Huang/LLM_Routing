- [The environment consists of 15 cities with specified coordinates starting from depot city 0 up to city 14.]
- [The robot must start and end its journey at the depot city (city 0).]
- [The robot's travel cost between any two cities is determined by calculating their Euclidean distance.]
- [Exactly 6 cities including the depot city must be visited in the tour.]
- [The objective is to find the shortest possible tour that includes exactly 6 cities.]
- [The solution to the task must be presented as a list of city indices, starting and ending at the depot city.]
- [The total travel cost of the tour should also be output.]
- [Employ a General Variable Neighborhood Search (GVNS) algorithm to solve the problem, following the detailed subroutines and structure provided such as GenerateInitialSolution, Shake, VND, and LocalSearch.]
- [Include neighborhood structures N1 (Exchange operation) and N2 (Swap operation) in the solution process.]
