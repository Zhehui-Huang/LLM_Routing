- [The robot needs to visit exactly 8 cities, including the depot city.]
- [The starting and ending point of the tour must be the depot city (City 0).]
- [The travel cost is calculated using the Euclidean distance between cities.]
- [The goal is to find the shortest possible tour that adheres to the constraints mentioned.]
- [The output should list the tour as a sequence of city indices and specify the total travel cost.]
