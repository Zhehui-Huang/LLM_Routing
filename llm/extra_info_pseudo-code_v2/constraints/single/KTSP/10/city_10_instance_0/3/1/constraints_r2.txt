- [The robot starts and ends its tour at the depot city, which is city 0.]
- [The robot can travel between any two cities, with the travel cost calculated using the Euclidean distance.]
- [The goal is to find the shortest possible tour that visits exactly 4 cities out of the 10 given, including the depot city.]
- [The output should consist of the tour as a list of city indices, starting and ending at city 0, and the total travel cost of the tour.]
