- [Requirement 1]: The robot must start and end the tour at the depot city, which is city 0.
- [Requirement 2]: The robot must visit exactly 4 cities, including the depot city.
- [Requirement 3]: The travel cost between cities is calculated using the Euclidean distance.
- [Requirement 4]: The objective is to find the shortest possible tour that covers the required cities.
- [Requirement 5]: The output of the function must be the tour as a list of city indices starting and ending at city 0, followed by the total travel cost of the tour.
- [Requirement 6]: Utilize the General Variable Neighborhood Search (GVNS) algorithm to solve the problem, following the provided pseudocode and its subroutines.
