- [The robot has to start and end the tour at depot city 0.]
- [The robot is required to visit exactly 8 cities, including the starting city.]
- [Travel cost is calculated using the Euclidean distance between any two cities.]
- [The goal is to find the shortest possible tour given these constraints.]
- [The output should include the tour as a list of city indices and the total travel cost of the tour.]
