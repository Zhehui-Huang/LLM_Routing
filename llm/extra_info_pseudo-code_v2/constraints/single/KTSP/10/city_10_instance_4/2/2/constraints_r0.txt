- [Requirement 1] The robot must start and end its tour at the depot city, which is city 0.
- [Requirement 2] The robot must visit exactly 8 cities, including the depot city.
- [Requirement 3] The goal is to find the shortest possible tour that visits exactly 8 cities.
- [Requirement 4] The travel cost is calculated as the Euclidean distance between any two cities.
- [Requirement 5] The output should list the city indices in the order of the tour, starting and ending at the depot city.
- [Requirement 6] The output should also include the total travel cost of the tour.
- [Requirement 7] The tour solution should be generated using the General Variable Neighborhood Search (GVNS) algorithm as described.
