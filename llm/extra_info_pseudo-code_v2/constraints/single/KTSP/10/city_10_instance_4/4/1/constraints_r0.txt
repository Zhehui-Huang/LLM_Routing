- [Requirement 1] The robot needs to start and end at the depot city 0.
- [Requirement 2] The robot must visit exactly 8 cities, including the depot city.
- [Requirement 3] The travel cost is calculated as the Euclidean distance between two cities.
- [Requirement 4] The goal is to find the shortest possible tour that visits these 8 cities.
- [Requirement 5] Output the tour as a list of city indices, beginning and ending at city 0.
- [Requirement 6] Output the total travel cost of the tour.
- [Requirement 7] Implement the solution using the General Variable Neighborhood Search (GV-GNS) algorithm as described, including its subroutines: GenerateInitialSolution, Shake, VND (Variable Neighborhood Descent), and LocalSearch.
