- [Requirement 1] The robot starts and ends the tour at the depot city 0.
- [Requirement 2] The robot must visit exactly 16 different cities, including the depot city.
- [Requirement 3] The objective is to find the shortest possible tour that minimizes the total travel cost, calculated based on the Euclidean distance between cities.
- [Requirement 4] The output should be in the format of a tour list starting and ending at city 0 and the total travel cost of the tour.
- [Requirement 5] Use the General Variable Neighborhood Search (GVNS) algorithm to solve the problem.
