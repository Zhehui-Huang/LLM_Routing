- [Requirement 1]: The robot must visit exactly 13 cities, including the starting and ending at the depot city (City 0).
- [Requirement 2]: The travel path should form a closed loop starting and ending at the depot city.
- [Requirement 3]: The objective is to minimize the total travel cost, which is the sum of the Euclidean distances between consecutively visited cities.
- [Requirement 4]: Each city, except the depot, can only be visited once in the tour.
- [Requirement 5]: The total number of cities including the depot is 20.
- [Requirement 6]: The output should list the sequence of visited city indices starting and ending at the depot city and the total travel cost of the tour.
- [Requirement 7]: Use the General Variable Neighborhood Search (GVNS) algorithm for solving the problem, applying specific neighborhood structures and local search methods as described.
