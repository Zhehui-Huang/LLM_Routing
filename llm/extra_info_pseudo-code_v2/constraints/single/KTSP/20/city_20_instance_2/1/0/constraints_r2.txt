- [Requirement 1] The robot must start and end the tour at the depot city, which is city 0.
- [Requirement 2] The tour must include exactly 10 cities from the provided 20 cities.
- [Requirement 3] The goal is to minimize the total travel cost, which is calculated using the Euclidean distance between cities.
- [Requirement 4] The final output should list the tour as an array of city indices, starting and ending at the depot city.
- [Requirement 5] The final output should also include the total travel cost of the tour.
- [Requirement 6] The solution should utilize the General Variable Neighborhood Search (GVNS) algorithm as outlined in the provided pseudocode, including its subroutines for generating initial solutions, shaking, and variable neighborhood descent.
