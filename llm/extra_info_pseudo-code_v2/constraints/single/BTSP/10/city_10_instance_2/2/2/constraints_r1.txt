- [Requirement 1] The robot must visit each city exactly once, starting and ending at the depot city 0.
- [Requirement 2] Output must show the entire tour as a list of city indices starting and ending at city 0.
- [Requirement 3] Output must include the total travel cost of the complete tour.
- [Requirement 4] Output must include the maximum distance between any two consecutive cities in the tour.
- [Requirement 5] The robot's travel cost is calculated based on the Euclidean distance between two cities.
- [Requirement 6] The goal is to minimize the longest distance between any two consecutive cities in the tour.
- [Requirement 7] Use the provided heuristic algorithm to find the Bottleneck Traveling Salesman Problem (BTSP) tour.
