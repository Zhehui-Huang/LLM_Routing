- [The robot needs to visit each city exactly once, starting and ending at the depot city 0.]
- [The goal is to minimize the longest distance between any two consecutive cities in the tour.]
- [The travel cost is calculated as the Euclidean distance between any two cities.]
- [Tour should be output as a list of city indices starting and ending at the depot city 0.]
- [Output should include the total travel cost of the tour.]
- [Output should include the maximum distance between any two consecutive cities in the tour.]
