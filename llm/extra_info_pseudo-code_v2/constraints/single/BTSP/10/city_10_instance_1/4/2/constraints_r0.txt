- [Requirement 1] The robot must start and end at the depot city 0.
- [Requirement 2] Each city must be visited exactly once by the robot.
- [Requirement 3] The goal is to minimize the longest distance between any two consecutive cities in the tour.
- [Requirement 4] The output should include the tour as a list of city indices starting and ending at city 0.
- [Requirement 5] The output should include the total travel cost of the tour.
- [Requirement 6] The output should include the maximum distance between any two consecutive cities in the tour.
- [Requirement 7] The travel cost between cities is calculated as the Euclidean distance.
- [Requirement 8] Use the provided heuristic algorithm focusing on obtaining a bottleneck-optimal biconnected subgraph followed by a Hamiltonian cycle to approximate the optimal tour.
