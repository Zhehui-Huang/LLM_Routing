- [The robot must visit each city exactly once, starting and ending at the depot city 0.]
- [The goal is to minimize the longest distance between any two consecutive cities in the tour.]
- [Travel cost between any two cities is calculated based on the Euclidean distance.]
- [The solution should output the tour as a list of city indices, the total travel cost of the tour, and the maximum distance between any two consecutive cities.]
- [The algorithm should involve creating a bottleneck-optimal biconnected subgraph and identifying an approximate optimal tour for the BTSP.]
