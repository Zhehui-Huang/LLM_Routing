- [Requirement 1] The robot must start and end at the depot city (city 0).
- [Requirement 2] Each city must be visited exactly once by the robot.
- [Requirement 3] The travel cost between any two cities is calculated as the Euclidean distance.
- [Requirement 4] Minimize the longest distance between any two consecutive cities in the tour.
- [Requirement 5] Output must include the tour as a list of city indices starting and ending at the depot city.
- [Requirement 6] Output must include the total travel cost of the tour.
- [Requirement 7] Output must include the maximum distance between any two consecutive cities in the tour.
- [Requirement 8] Use a heuristic algorithm involving the creation of a biconnected subgraph and identifying an approximate optimal tour through this subgraph.
