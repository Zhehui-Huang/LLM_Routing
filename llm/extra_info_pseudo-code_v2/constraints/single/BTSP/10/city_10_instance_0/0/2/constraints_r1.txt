- [The robot is required to start and end its journey at the depot city, which is city 0.]
- [The robot must visit each city exactly once, excluding the depot city where it visits twice (beginning and end).]
- [The goal is to minimize the maximum distance between any two consecutive cities in the tour.]
- [The travel cost between cities is calculated using the Euclidean distance between their coordinates.]
- [The solution must involve computing a bottleneck-optimal biconnected subgraph of the graph representing the cities and their distances.]
- [The task requires identifying a Hamiltonian cycle in the squared graph of the bottleneck-optimal biconnected subgraph.]
- [The output must provide the tour as a list of city indices starting and ending at the depot city 0.]
- [The output must include the total travel cost of the tour.]
- [The output must list the maximum distance between any two consecutive cities in the tour.]
