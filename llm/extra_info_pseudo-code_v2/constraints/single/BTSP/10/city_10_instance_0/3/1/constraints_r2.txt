- [There are 10 cities labeled from 0 to 9, with city 0 serving as the depot.]
- [Coordinates for each city are given, with city 0 at (50, 42), city 1 at (41, 1), city 2 at (18, 46), city 3 at (40, 98), city 4 at (51, 69), city 5 at (47, 39), city 6 at (62, 26), city 7 at (79, 31), city 8 at (61, 90), and city 9 at (42, 49).]
- [One robot starts at the depot, city 0, and must visit each city exactly once and then return to the depot.]
- [Travel cost between any two cities is the Euclidean distance between their coordinates.]
- [The goal is to minimize the longest distance between any two consecutive cities in the tour.]
- [The solution must be an approximate one based on the provided heuristic algorithm that constructs a bottleneck-optimal biconnected subgraph and identifies an approximate optimal tour.]
- [The output should present the tour as a list of city indices starting and ending at the depot city 0.]
- [The output should include the total travel cost of the tour.]
- [The output should also include the maximum distance between any two consecutive cities in the tour.]
