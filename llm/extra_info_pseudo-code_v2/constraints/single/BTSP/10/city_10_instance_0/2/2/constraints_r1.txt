- [There are 10 cities with specific coordinates, including the depot city 0.]
- [There is one robot that starts and ends its route at the depot city 0.]
- [The robot must visit each city exactly once.]
- [The travel cost between cities is calculated using the Euclidean distance between their coordinates.]
- [The goal is to minimize the longest distance between any two consecutive cities in the robot's tour.]
- [The output tour must start and end at the depot city 0.]
- [The solution output should include the tour as a list of city indices, the total travel cost of the tour, and the maximum distance between any two consecutive cities.]
