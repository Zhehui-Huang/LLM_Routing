- [Requirement 1] Solve the BTSP using a heuristic that forms a bottleneck-optimal biconnected subgraph of the cities' graph, minimizing the longest distance between consecutive cities in the tour.
- [Requirement 2] The tour must start and end at the depot city 0, visiting each city exactly once.
- [Requirement 3] The output must include the tour as a list of city indices, the total travel cost, and the maximum distance between any two consecutive cities in the tour.
