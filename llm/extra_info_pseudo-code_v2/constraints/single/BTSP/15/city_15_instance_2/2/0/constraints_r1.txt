- [There are 15 cities, including the depot city 0.]
- [The cities' coordinates are given explicitly.]
- [There is one robot that needs to visit each city exactly once, starting and ending at the depot city 0.]
- [The robot can travel between any two cities.]
- [The travel cost is the Euclidean distance between two cities.]
- [The objective is to minimize the longest distance between any two consecutive cities in the tour.]
- [The solution should apply a heuristic algorithm to find an approximate solution to the task.]
- [The output should include the tour as a list of city indices starting and ending at the depot city 0.]
- [The output should also include the total travel cost of the tour.]
- [The output should further include the maximum distance between any two consecutive cities in the tour.]
