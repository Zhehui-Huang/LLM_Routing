- [Requirement 1] The robot must visit each city exactly once and must start and end at the depot city (city 0).
- [Requirement 2] The objective is to minimize the longest distance between any two consecutive cities in the tour.
- [Requirement 3] The output must include the tour as a list of city indices starting and ending at city 0.
- [Requirement 4] The output must include the total travel cost of the tour.
- [Requirement 5] The output must include the maximum distance between any two consecutive cities in the tour.
- [Requirement 6] Use a heuristic algorithm, specifically a Bottleneck-optimal Biconnected Subgraph (Step 1) followed by Tour Identification (Step 2) to find the approximate optimal tour for BTSP.
