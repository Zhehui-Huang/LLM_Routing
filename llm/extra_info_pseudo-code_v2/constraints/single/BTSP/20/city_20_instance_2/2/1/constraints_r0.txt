- [Requirement 1] There are 20 cities with given specific coordinates, and the city 0 is designated as the depot.
- [Requirement 2] The robot must start and end the tour at the depot city (city 0).
- [Requirement 3] The robot must visit each of the cities exactly once.
- [Requirement 4] The cost of travel between any two cities is calculated using the Euclidean distance.
- [Requirement 5] The goal is to minimize the longest distance between any two consecutive cities in the robot's tour.
- [Requirement 6] Output should consist of the tour sequence starting and ending at city 0, the total travel cost of the tour, and the maximum distance between any two consecutive cities.
- [Requirement 7] The proposed algorithm involves creating a bottleneck-optimal biconnected subgraph of the provided graph of cities followed by identifying an approximate optimal Hamiltonian cycle in this subgraph's square to define the robot's tour.
- [Requirement 8] The task requires the application of the Bottleneck-optimal Biconnected Subgraph heuristic, involving specific sorting, augmentation, and checking operations to achieve the specified goal.
