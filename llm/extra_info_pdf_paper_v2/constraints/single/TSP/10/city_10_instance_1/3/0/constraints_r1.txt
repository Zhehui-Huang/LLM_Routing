- [The robot must visit all cities exactly once, except the depot city, and then return to the depot city.]
- [Travel cost between two cities is calculated as the Euclidean distance.]
- [The starting and ending point of the tour must be the depot city 0.]
- [The solution must output the shortest possible tour and its total travel cost.]
- [Output should include a tour list starting and ending at city 0 and the total travel cost.]
