- [The robot visits 10 cities, starting and ending at the depot city (City 0).]
- [The robot must visit each city exactly once, except the depot city which must be visited twiceâ€”once at the beginning and once at the end.]
- [Travel cost between cities is calculated using the Euclidean distance formula.]
- [The objective is to find the shortest possible tour that visits each city exactly once and returns to the depot city.]
- [The final output should be a list of city indices representing the tour, starting and ending at city 0.]
- [The final output should also include the total travel cost of the tour.]
