- [There are 10 cities labeled from 0 to 9, with specified coordinates for each city.]
- [There is one robot which starts at the depot city 0.]
- [The robot must visit all cities exactly once, except the depot city, and then return to the depot city.]
- [The robot can travel between any two cities.]
- [The travel cost is calculated as the Euclidean distance between the two cities.]
- [The output should include the shortest tour starting and ending at the depot city 0, formatted as a list of city indices.]
- [The output should also include the total travel cost of the tour.]
