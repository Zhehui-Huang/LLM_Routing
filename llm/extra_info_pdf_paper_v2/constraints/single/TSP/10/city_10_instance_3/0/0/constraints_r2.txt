- [The environment consists of 10 specific cities with predefined coordinates.]
- [The robot must start and end its journey at the depot city, which is city 0.]
- [The robot should visit each city exactly once, except for the depot city, which will be visited twice (start and end).]
- [Travel cost between cities is based on Euclidean distance.]
- [The goal is to determine the shortest possible tour that meets the visiting requirements.]
- [Tour output should be in the form of a list of city indices starting and ending at the depot city.]
- [Total travel cost of the tour should be computed and included in the output.]
