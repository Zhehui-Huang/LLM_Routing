- [The robot must visit each city exactly once, except for the depot city.]
- [The tour of the robot must start and end at the depot city (city index 0).]
- [The total travel cost, calculated as the Euclidean distance between cities, must be minimized.]
- [The robot's route between two cities is determined by the Euclidean distance which is the travel cost criterion.]
