- [Requirement 1]: The robot must start and end at the depot city (City 0).
- [Requirement 2]: Each city must be visited exactly once by the robot, except for the depot city.
- [Requirement 3]: The solution must output the tour in the form of a list of city indices, starting and ending at the depot city.
- [Requirement 4]: The solution must calculate and output the total travel cost of the tour.
- [Requirement 5]: Travel cost is calculated using the Euclidean distance between cities.
- [Requirement 6]: Implement an approach based on the Lin-Kernighan heuristic to find the shortest tour.
