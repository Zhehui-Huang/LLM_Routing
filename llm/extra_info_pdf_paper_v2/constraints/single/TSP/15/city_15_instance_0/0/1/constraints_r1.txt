- [The problem involves 15 cities including a depot city, with specific coordinates provided for each.]
- [There is one robot that begins its traversal at the depot city 0, and returns to the depot city after visiting all other cities exactly once.]
- [The travel cost between any two cities is evaluated using the Euclidean distance.]
- [The objective of the problem is to find the shortest possible round tour for achieving this.]
- [The output should list the sequence of cities visited starting and ending at the depot city, followed by the total travel cost of the journey.]
