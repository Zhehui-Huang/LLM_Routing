- [Requirement 1] The robot must start at the depot city (city index 0) and must return to the depot city after visiting all other cities.
- [Requirement 2] Each city, except the depot, must be visited exactly once by the robot.
- [Requirement 3] The travel cost between any two cities is calculated using the Euclidean distance.
- [Requirement 4] The solution must output the tour as a list of city indices starting and ending at the depot city.
- [Requirement 5] The solution must also output the total travel cost of the tour.
- [Requirement 6] The goal is to find the shortest possible tour satisfying these constraints.
