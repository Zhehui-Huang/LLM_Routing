- [The robot must visit each city exactly once, starting and ending at the depot city 0.]
- [Travel cost between cities is calculated using the Euclidean distance.]
- [The goal is to minimize the maximum distance between any two consecutive cities in the tour.]
- [The output should include the tour as a list of city indices starting and ending at depot city 0.]
- [The output should include the total travel cost of the tour.]
- [The output should include the maximum distance between any two consecutive cities in the tour.]
