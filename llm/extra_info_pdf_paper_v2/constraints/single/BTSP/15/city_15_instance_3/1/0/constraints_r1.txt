- [Each city must be visited exactly once by the robot.]
- [The objective is to minimize the longest distance between any two consecutive cities in the tour.]
- [Distance between cities is calculated using the Euclidean distance.]
- [Output should include the complete tour starting and ending at city 0, the total travel cost, and the maximum distance between any two consecutive cities.]
