- [The robot must start and end its journey at depot city 0.]
- [The robot must visit each city exactly once.]
- [The travel cost between any two cities is determined by their Euclidean distance.]
- [The goal is to minimize the longest distance between any two consecutive cities in the tour.]
- [The solution output should include the tour as a list of city indices.]
- [The solution output should include the total travel cost of the tour.]
- [The solution output should include the maximum distance between any two consecutive cities in the tour.]
