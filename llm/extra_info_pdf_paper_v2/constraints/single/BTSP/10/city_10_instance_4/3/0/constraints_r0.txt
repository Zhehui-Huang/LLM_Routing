- [Robot must start and end the journey at depot city 0.]
- [Robot must visit each city exactly once.]
- [The goal is to minimize the maximum distance between any two consecutive cities in the tour.]
- [Travel distances between cities are calculated using the Euclidean formula.]
- [Only one robot is used for the entire route.]
- [The solution should output the tour as a list of city indices, starting and ending at depot city 0.]
- [The solution should output the total travel cost of the tour.]
- [The solution should output the maximum distance between any two consecutive cities in the tour.]
