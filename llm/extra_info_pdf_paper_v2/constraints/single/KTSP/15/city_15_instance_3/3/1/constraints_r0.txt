- [Requirement 2] The robot must visit exactly 10 cities out of the given 15 cities.
- [Requirement 3] The tourâ€™s travel cost is calculated based on the Euclidean distance between cities.
- [Requirement 4] The goal is to find the shortest possible route for the specified 10-city tour.
- [Requirement 5] The results should include the sequence of visited cities and the total travel cost.
- [Requirement 6] The solution should be based on a method similar to the general variable neighborhood search algorithm as used for k-TSP.
- [Requirement 7] The provided location coordinates of each city should be used for determining distances.
