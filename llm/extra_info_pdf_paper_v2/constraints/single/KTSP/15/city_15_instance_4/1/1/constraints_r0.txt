- [There are 15 cities, with given coordinates for each, including the depot city (City 0).]
- [The robot starts and ends its tour at the depot city, City 0.]
- [The tour must include exactly 12 cities out of the 15 available.]
- [Travel cost is calculated based on the Euclidean distance between two cities.]
- [The objective is to find the shortest possible tour that adheres to these constraints.]
- [The tour and the total travel cost should be returned, with the tour formatted as a list of city indices starting and ending at city 0.]
