- [The task requires computing a route for the robot that starts and ends at depot city 0.]
- [The robot must visit exactly 12 cities, chosen from a total of 15 possible cities.]
- [The robot can travel between any two cities directly, with travel costs determined by the Euclidean distance between them.]
- [The goal is to find the shortest possible tour, i.e., a tour with the minimum travel distance.]
- [The output should be a list of city indices representing the tour starting and ending at the depot city, followed by the total travel cost of this tour.]
