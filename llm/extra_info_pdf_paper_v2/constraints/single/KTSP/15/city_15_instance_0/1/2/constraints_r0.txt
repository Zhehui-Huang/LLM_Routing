- [Requirement 1] The robot starts and ends the tour at the depot city 0.
- [Requirement 2] The tour must consist of exactly 4 cities, including the depot.
- [Requirement 3] The tour's travel cost is calculated as the Euclidean distance between the sequential cities visited.
- [Requirement 4] The solution must seek the shortest possible travel path considering the path constraints.
- [Requirement 5] The output should be in the format: Tour (list of city indices starting and ending at depot city) and total travel cost.
- [Requirement 6] The solution should leverage the insights from the provided research on general variable neighborhood search (GVNS) algorithms for the k-TSP problem.
