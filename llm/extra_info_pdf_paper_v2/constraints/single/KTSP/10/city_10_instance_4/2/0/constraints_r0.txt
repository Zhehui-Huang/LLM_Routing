- [The robot must start and end its journey at the depot city, which is city 0.]
- [The robot must visit exactly 8 cities, including the depot city.]
- [The goal is to minimize the total travel cost, calculated as the Euclidean distance between visited cities.]
- [The output should include the optimized tour starting and ending at city 0, formatted as a list of city indices.]
- [The output should also include the total travel cost of the optimized tour.]
