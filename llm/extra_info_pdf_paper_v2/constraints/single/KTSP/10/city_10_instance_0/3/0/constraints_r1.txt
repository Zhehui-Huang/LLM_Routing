- [The robot must start and end its tour at the depot city 0.]
- [The robot must visit exactly 4 cities, including the depot city.]
- [The total number of cities in the problem is 10.]
- [The objective is to find the shortest possible tour under the given conditions.]
- [The travel cost between two cities is computed as the Euclidean distance between them.]
- [The output format for the result should be: Tour: followed by a list of city indices starting and ending at city 0, and Total travel cost followed by the cost value.]
