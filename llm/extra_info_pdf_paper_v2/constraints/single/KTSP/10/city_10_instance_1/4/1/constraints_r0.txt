- [There are 10 cities, each represented by a unique number from 0 (depot) to 9.]
- [The robot must start and end its tour at the depot city, which is city 0.]
- [The robot needs to visit exactly 5 cities, including the depot city.]
- [Travel cost is determined by the Euclidean distance between cities.]
- [The goal is to determine the shortest possible tour that visits exactly 5 cities.]
- [The tour must be represented as a list of city indices starting and ending at the depot city.]
- [The output must include the tour and the total travelcost of this tour.]
