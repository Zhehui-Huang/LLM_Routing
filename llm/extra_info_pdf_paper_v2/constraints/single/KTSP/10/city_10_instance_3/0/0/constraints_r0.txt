- [The robot must start and end its journey at the depot city, which is city 0.]
- [The robot needs to visit exactly 7 cities from the 10 available cities.]
- [The objective is to find the shortest possible total travel cost for the tour.]
- [Travel cost between any two cities is computed based on the Euclidean distance.]
- [The output should include the sequence of the tour starting and ending at depot city 0, and also include the total travel cost.]
