- [The robot must start and end the tour at depot city 0.]
- [The robot must visit exactly one city from each city group.]
- [The robot can only move between any two cities directly, and the travel cost between them is the Euclidean distance.]
- [The total number of city groups is 5, each containing specific cities: Group 0: [8, 12, 14], Group 1: [7, 10, 11], Group 2: [4, 6, 9], Group 3: [1, 3, 13], Group 4: [2, 5].]
- [The travel path should be the shortest possible, adhering to the other constraints.]
