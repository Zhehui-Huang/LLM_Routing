- [The environment consists of 15 cities, each defined by specific coordinates.]
- [City coordinates for the depot (City 0) are (54, 87). Additional 14 cities have individual coordinates provided.]
- [Cities are organized into 5 groups, with each group containing specific city indices.]
- [The robot must start and end its journey at the depot City 0.]
- [The robot is required to visit exactly one city from each of the 5 city groups during its tour.]
- [Travel cost between any two cities is calculated using the Euclidean distance.]
- [The task seeks the shortest possible tour that fulfills all the travel constraints.]
- [Output should include both the sequence of the tour starting and ending at City 0 and the total travel cost of this tour.]
- [Each city can be represented by its index in output and calculations.]
