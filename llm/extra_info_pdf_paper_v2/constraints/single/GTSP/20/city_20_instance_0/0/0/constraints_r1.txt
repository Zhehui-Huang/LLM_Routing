- [There are 20 cities indexed from 0 to 19, with their coordinates provided.]
- [City 0 is the depot city, starting and ending point for the robot.]
- [Cities are divided into 3 groups: Group 0: [1, 3, 5, 11, 13, 14, 19], Group 1: [2, 6, 7, 8, 12, 15], Group 2: [4, 9, 10, 16, 17, 18].]
- [The robot must visit exactly one city from each group.]
- [Travel cost between any two cities is calculated using the Euclidean distance.]
- [The robot's task is to find the shortest tour starting and ending at the depot city.]
- [Output should be the tour as a list of city indices and the total travel cost.]
- [Tour must begin and end at the depot city.]
