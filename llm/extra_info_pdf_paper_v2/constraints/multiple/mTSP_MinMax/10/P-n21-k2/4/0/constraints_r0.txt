- [There are 21 cities with specific coordinates provided, including a depot city (city 0).]
- [Two robots are available, both starting at the depot city.]
- [Each robot must start and end their tour at the depot city 0.]
- [Robots must collectively visit all other cities exactly once, without revisiting the depot city as a destination in the middle of the tour.]
- [The travel cost between cities is calculated using the Euclidean distance.]
- [The objective is to minimize the maximum distance traveled by any single robot.]
- [The output should present the tour for each robot, the travel cost of each tour, and the maximum travel cost among all tours.]
