- [Requirement 1] The robots must start and end their tour at the depot city 0.
- [Requirement 2] Each city, except the depot, is visited exactly once collectively by all robots.
- [Requirement 3] The goal is to minimize the maximum distance traveled by any single robot.
- [Requirement 4] The travel cost between two cities is calculated using the Euclidean distance.
- [Requirement 5] The output should list tours for each robot starting and ending at the depot, including the total travel cost for each tour and the maximum travel cost among all tours.
- [Requirement 6] There are two robots available to solve this variant of the mTSP.
