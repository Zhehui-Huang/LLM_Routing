- [Requirement 1] There are 22 cities, including a depot city (city 0), and the robots must collectively visit all cities exactly once before returning to the depot city.
- [Requirement 2] Each robot starts and ends its tour at the depot city, city 0.
- [Requirement 3] The primary objective is to minimize the maximum distance traveled by any single robot.
- [Requirement 4] The travel cost between cities is calculated as the Euclidean distance between them.
- [Requirement 5] The solution must output the tours for each robot as a list of city indices, starting and ending at the depot city.
- [Requirement 6] The solution must output the travel cost for each tour and the maximum travel cost among all tours.
