- [There are 22 cities, including a depot city labeled as city 0.]
- [All 4 robots start their journey from the depot city 0.]
- [Each city, except the depot, must be visited exactly once by any of the robots.]
- [After visiting the assigned cities, each robot must return to the depot city 0.]
- [The travel cost is calculated as the Euclidean distance between two cities.]
- [The objective is to minimize the maximum travel distance traveled by any single robot.]
- [Each robot can travel between any two cities.]
- [Each tour must start and end at the depot city 0.]
- [The solution format should list the tours for each robot and include the travel cost for each tour and the maximum travel cost among all tours.]
