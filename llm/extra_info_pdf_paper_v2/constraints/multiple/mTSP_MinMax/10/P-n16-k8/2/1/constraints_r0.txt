- [There are 16 cities including a depot city.]
- [Coordinates for each city are specified.]
- [There are 8 robots, all starting from the depot city (city 0).]
- [Robots must visit all cities exactly once, excluding the depot city as a destination, and return to the depot city after completing their tours.]
- [The primary objective is to minimize the maximum distance traveled by any single robot.]
- [Each robot's travel cost is calculated using the Euclidean distance between cities.]
- [Output should be the tours for each robot, starting and ending at the depot, with the travel costs for each tour and the maximum travel cost among all tours.]
