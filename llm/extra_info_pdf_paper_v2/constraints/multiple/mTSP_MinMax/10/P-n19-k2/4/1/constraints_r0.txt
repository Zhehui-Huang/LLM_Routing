- [Requirement 1] There are 19 cities, with precise coordinates provided for each, including a starting depot city.
- [Requirement 2] There are 2 robots starting and ending their route at the depot city. Each robot must collectively visit all other cities exactly once and then return to the depot.
- [Requirement 3] The primary goal is to minimize the maximum distance traveled by any single robot, using the Euclidean distance as the metric for travel cost.
- [Requirement 4] Each robot's tour output should be a list starting and ending at the depot city, specifying the exact sequence of city visits.
- [Requirement 5] Output must also include the total travel cost for each robot's tour and the maximum of these travel costs.
