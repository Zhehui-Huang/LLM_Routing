- [There are 23 cities, each identified by unique indices from 0 to 22, with specified coordinates.]
- [There are 8 robots, all starting and ending their tours at the depot city identified by index 0.]
- [Each robot must visit all cities exactly once, excluding the depot city, which is not a destination.]
- [Travel cost is calculated as the Euclidean distance between two cities.]
- [The main objective is to minimize the maximum distance traveled by any single robot.]
- [The solution should use insights from the general variable neighborhood search heuristic for mTSP, focusing on MinMax to balance the workload among robots.] 
- [Each tour should be provided as a list starting and ending at the depot city, along with the total travel cost for that tour.]
- [Output must include the maximum travel cost among all tours.]
