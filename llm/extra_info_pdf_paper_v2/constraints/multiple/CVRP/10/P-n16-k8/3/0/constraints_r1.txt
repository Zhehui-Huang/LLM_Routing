- [There are 16 cities, including a depot city indexed at 0.]
- [The locations of cities are provided as (x, y) coordinates.]
- [Each city, including the depot, has a defined demand for goods, with the depot's demand being 0.]
- [There are 8 robots available with a carrying capacity of 35 units each.]
- [All robots start their delivery and return to the depot city 0 after completing their routes.]
- [Travel costs between cities are calculated based on the Euclidean distance between their coordinates.]
- [The objective is to minimize the total travel cost of all robots' routes.]
- [Each city's demand must be fully met without exceeding the robot's capacity.]
- [Solution output should display the tour of each robot starting and ending at city 0, the total travel cost for each robot's tour, and the sum of all these costs.]
