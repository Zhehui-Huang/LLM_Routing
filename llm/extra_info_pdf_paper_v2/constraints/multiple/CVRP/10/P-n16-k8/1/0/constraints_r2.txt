- [Requirement 1] Each robot's tour must start and end at the depot city (city 0).
- [Requirement 2] The demand of each city must be fully met by the robots.
- [Requirement 3] The carrying capacity of each robot (35 units) must not be exceeded.
- [Requirement 4] Minimize the total travel cost for all the robots' tours, calculated as the Euclidean distance between cities.
- [Requirement 5] Each robot must travel back to the depot city after completing its deliveries.
- [Requirement 6] Only the cities with non-zero demand need to be included in the tours, except the depot city.
- [Requirement 7] All routes formed in the tours must be feasible considering the Euclidean travel distances between cities.
- [Requirement 8] Use the Enhanced Clarke-Wright Savings Algorithm for optimization to achieve minimum travel cost efficiently.
- [Requirement 9] Ensure the distribution of routes and city deliveries among the robots is optimized according to the demands and capacities.
- [Requirement 10] The solution must collectively involve all eight robots starting from the depot city.
