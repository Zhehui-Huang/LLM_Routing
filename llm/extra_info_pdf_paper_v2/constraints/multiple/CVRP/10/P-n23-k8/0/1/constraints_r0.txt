- [There are 23 cities, including a depot city labeled as City 0 with coordinates (30, 40).]
- [Each city has specified geographic coordinates and a demand amount that must be fulfilled.]
- [There are 8 robots, each with a carrying capacity of 40.]
- [All robots start and end their tours at the depot city (City 0).]
- [Robots can travel between any two cities, and the travel cost is calculated as the Euclidean distance between city coordinates.]
- [The objective is to minimize the total travel cost for all tours.]
- [Each city’s demand must be completely met without exceeding the robot’s capacity constraints.]
- [The output should list each robot’s tour starting and ending at the depot city, the travel cost for each robot’s tour, and the overall total travel cost.]
