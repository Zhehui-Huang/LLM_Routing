- [Requirement 3] The cumulative demand served by each robot in a single trip must not exceed the robot's capacity limit of 40.
- [Requirement 4] The goal is to minimize the total travel cost for all tours while respecting the demand and capacity constraints.
- [Requirement 5] Output the specific tours for each robot as a list of city indices, showing both the start and the end at the depot city.
- [Requirement 6] Output the total travel cost for each tour and the combined total travel cost for all tours.
