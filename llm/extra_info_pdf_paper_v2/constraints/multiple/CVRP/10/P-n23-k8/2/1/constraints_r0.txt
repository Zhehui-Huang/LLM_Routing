- [There are 23 cities including the depot city which is City 0.]
- [Each robot must start and end its tour at the depot city 0.]
- [Each city (excluding the depot) has a specific demand that must be fully met by the deliveries.]
- [There are 8 robots each with a carrying capacity of 40.]
- [Robots can travel between any two cities and travel cost is the Euclidean distance between them.]
- [The objective is to minimize the total travel cost for all tours.]
- [Capacity constraints of the robots must not be exceeded.]
- [Each tour for each robot should be organized as a list starting and ending at the depot, represented by city index 0.]
- [The output should include tours for each robot and the total travel cost for each tour along with the overall total travel cost.]
