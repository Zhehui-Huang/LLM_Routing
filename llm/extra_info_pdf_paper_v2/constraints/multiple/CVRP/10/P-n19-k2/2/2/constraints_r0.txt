- [There are 19 cities including the depot with defined coordinates and demand for each city.]
- [Two robots with a starting location at depot city 0, each robot having a carrying capacity of 160 units.]
- [Travel between any two cities is possible, with costs calculated using the Euclidean distance between the cities.]
- [The robots' objectives are to collectively deliver all required goods to the cities while returning to the depot city after deliveries.]
- [It is necessary to ensure that the total demand of each city is fully met.]
- [The total goods carried by the robots must not exceed each robot's capacity constraints at any time.]
- [The goal is to minimize the overall total travel cost for all tours.]
- [Each robot's tour must start and end at the depot city 0.]
- [Output must include the tour paths for each robot, the total travel cost for each tour, and the overall total travel cost.]
