- [There are 19 cities including the depot city 0.]
- [Each city has specific coordinates provided.]
- [Each city has a specific demand that needs to be met, except for the depot city which has a demand of 0.]
- [There are 2 robots available to perform deliveries.]
- [Each robot has a carrying capacity of 160 units.]
- [All robots start their deliveries from the depot city 0.]
- [Robots can travel between any two cities.]
- [Travel cost between two cities is calculated based on the Euclidean distance.]
- [Robots must deliver goods to all cities excluding the depot, and return to the depot city after completing their deliveries.]
- [The robot tours must ensure that the city demands are fully met and the capacity constraints of the robots are not exceeded.]
- [The task is to determine the shortest possible tours for the robots, aiming to minimize the total travel cost for all tours.]
- [The output format requires listing the tours for each robot as a sequence of city indices, starting and ending at the depot city.]
- [The output should include the total travel cost for each tour and the overall total travel capabilities.]
- [The enhanced Clarke-Wright Savings Algorithm with a two-phase probabilistic mechanism and a route post-improvement procedure can be used to improve route solutions.]
