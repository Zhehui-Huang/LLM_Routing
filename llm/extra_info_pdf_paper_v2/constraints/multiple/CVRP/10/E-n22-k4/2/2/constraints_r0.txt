- [There are 22 cities with specified coordinates, including a depot city.]
- [Each city has a specific demand that must be fully met.]
- [There are 4 robots with a uniform capacity of 6000 each.]
- [All robots start from the depot city 0.]
- [Robots can travel between any two cities.]
- [Travel cost is calculated as the Euclidean distance between cities.]
- [The objective is to determine the shortest possible tours for the robots ensuring capacity constraints are not exceeded.]
- [Each travel tour should start and end at the depot city 0.]
- [Output should list tours for each robot, the total travel cost for each tour, and the overall total travel cost.]
