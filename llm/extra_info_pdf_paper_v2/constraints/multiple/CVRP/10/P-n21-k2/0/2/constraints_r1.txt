- [There are 21 cities, including a depot city (city 0).]
- [Each city (excluding the depot) has a specific demand that must be met.]
- [There are 2 robots, each with a carrying capacity of 160 units.]
- [All robots start their journey from the depot city 0.]
- [Travel between any two cities is possible for the robots.]
- [The travel cost is computed as the Euclidean distance between two cities.]
- [The objective is to minimize the total travel cost for all tours made by the robots.]
- [Each robot's tour must start and end at the depot city 0.]
- [The robots' total carrying capacity must not be exceeded during any part of their tours.]
- [Output should include the route of each robot and the cost associated with each tour, as well as the total combined travel cost of all tours.]
