- [Requirement 1] The robots must deliver goods to all cities excluding the depot (city 0) and return to the depot after completing their deliveries.
- [Requirement 2] Each city's demand must be fully met through the deliveries.
- [Requirement 3] The load carried by each robot on any tour must not exceed its capacity of 160.
- [Requirement 4] The objective is to determine the shortest possible tours that minimize the total travel cost for all tours.
- [Requirement 5] Output should include the tours for each robot as lists of city indices starting and ending at the depot city.
- [Requirement 6] Output should include the total travel cost for each tour and the overall total travel cost.
- [Requirement 7] Ensure that the enhancements to the Clarke-Wright Savings Algorithm such as the two-phase probabilistic mechanism and the route post-improvement procedure are considered for implementing the solution.
