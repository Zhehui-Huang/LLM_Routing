- [Total number of cities is 21, including the depot city.]
- [Exact geographical coordinates are provided for each city.]
- [Each city has a specific demand amount that must be fulfilled, excluding the depot city which has zero demand.]
- [There are 2 robots available for fulfilling the city demands.]
- [Each robot has a maximum carrying capacity of 160.]
- [All robots start their delivery tours from the depot city (city 0).]
- [Robots can travel between any two cities.]
- [Travel cost is calculated based on the Euclidean distance between cities.]
- [The total solution must minimize the travel costs involved while completing the tours.]
- [Each robot must return to the depot city after finishing its deliveries.]
- [The output should list the city indices in the tour for each robot, starting and ending at the depot city.]
- [Each robotâ€™s total tour cost must be provided along with the collective total travel cost for all tours.]
- [The Clarke-Wright Savings Algorithm with enhancements should be used or considered for solving this problem.]
