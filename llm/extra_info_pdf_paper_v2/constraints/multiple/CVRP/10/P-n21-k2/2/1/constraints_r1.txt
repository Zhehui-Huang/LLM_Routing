- [Each robot must start and return to the depot city 0.]
- [The total carrying capacity of each robot cannot be exceeded during the tour.]
- [The demand for each city must be met exactly without any shortages.]
- [The travel cost between cities is calculated as the Euclidean distance.]
- [The objective is to minimize the total travel cost for all tours combined.]
