- [There are 19 cities, including two depots (city 0 and city 1).]
- [Two robots are available, both starting from depot city 0.]
- [Robots can travel between any two cities.]
- [Travel cost is calculated as the Euclidean distance between cities.]
- [Robots need to collectively visit all cities exactly once.]
- [Each robot starts from a designated depot (depot city 0 for both) but does not need to return to the depot after completing its tour.]
- [The goal is to determine the shortest tours for each robot while minimizing the total travel cost for all robots combined.]
- [The output should list tours for each robot, starting and ending at their assigned depot, along with the total travel cost for each tour and the overall total travel cost.]
