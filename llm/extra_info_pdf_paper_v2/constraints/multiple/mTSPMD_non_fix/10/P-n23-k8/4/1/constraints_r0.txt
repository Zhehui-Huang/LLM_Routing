- [Requirement 4] Each city must be visited exactly once by any robot, with the collective task of visiting all cities.
- [Requirement 5] The goal is to determine the shortest tours for each robot while minimizing the total travel cost for all robots combined.
- [Requirement 6] The output should list each robot's tour starting and ending at its assigned depot and include both individual and total travel costs.
