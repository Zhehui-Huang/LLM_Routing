- [Requirement 1] There are 23 cities, each with specified coordinates, including a depot city 0 at (30, 40). All cities must be included in the tours.
- [Requirement 2] There are 8 robots. All robots start and return to the depot city 0 after completing their tours. Each robot must start and end its tour at the depot city.
- [Requirement 3] The objective is to minimize the total travel cost, computed as the sum of the Euclidean distances between consecutive cities visited by the robots.
- [Requirement 4] Each city, except the depot city, must be visited exactly once across all robots.
