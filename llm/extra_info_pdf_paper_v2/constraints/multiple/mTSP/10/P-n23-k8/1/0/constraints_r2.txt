- [Requirement 1] There are 23 cities including a depot; coordinates are provided for all.
- [Requirement 2] Eight robots are available, and all start and end their tour at the depot city (city index 0).
- [Requirement 3] Robots must collectively visit each city exactly once (except the depot city) and then return to the depot.
- [Requirement 4] The objective is to find the shortest possible collective tours for the robots, minimizing the total travel cost.
- [Requirement 5] Each city (except the depot) must be visited exactly once by the robots collectively.
- [Requirement 6] Travel cost between cities is calculated using Euclidean distance.
- [Requirement 7] Output format: List the tours for each robot starting and ending at the depot. Output total travel cost for each tour and the overall travel cost.
