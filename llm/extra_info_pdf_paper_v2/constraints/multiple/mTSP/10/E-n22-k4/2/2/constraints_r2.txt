- [Requirement 1] There are 22 cities including the depot city, and each of the four robots should start and end its journey at the depot city (city 0).
- [Requirement 2] Each city, except the depot, must be visited exactly once across all robots.
- [Requirement 3] The travel cost for each robot is calculated as the Euclidean distance between consecutive cities in its tour, with the goal to minimize the total distance traveled by all robots collectively.
- [Requirement 4] Output must include the route for each robot starting and ending at the depot as well as the total distance for each route and the overall distance covered by all robots.
- [Requirement 5] Utilize heuristic or hybrid techniques such as genetic algorithms, tabu search, or simulated annealing for solving the multi-Traveling Salesman Problem (mTSP), aiming to find an optimal route with balanced workload among robots.
