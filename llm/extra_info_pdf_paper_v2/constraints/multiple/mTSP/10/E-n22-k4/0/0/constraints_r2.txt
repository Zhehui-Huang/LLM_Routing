- [There are 22 cities, including the depot city 0.]
- [All robots start at depot city 0.]
- [Robots can travel between any two cities.]
- [Travel cost between cities is calculated using the Euclidean distance.]
- [Each robot must visit all cities exactly once, excluding the depot city as a destination.]
- [Each robot must return to the depot city after completing their tours.]
- [The objective is to minimize the total travel cost for all robots collectively.]
- [Tours and total travel cost must be output for each robot, plus an overall total travel cost.]
