- [There are 22 cities numbered from 0 to 21 with given coordinates.]
- [Four robots are available. All robots start and end their journey at the depot city, which is city 0.]
- [Each city, except the depot city, must be visited exactly once by any of the robots.]
- [Travel cost is calculated using the Euclidean distance between two cities.]
- [The objective is to minimize the total travel cost while ensuring all cities are visited and each route starts and ends at the depot.]
- [Output should include the tour for each robot starting and ending at depo city 0, the travel cost for each tour, and the overall combined travel cost of all tours.]
