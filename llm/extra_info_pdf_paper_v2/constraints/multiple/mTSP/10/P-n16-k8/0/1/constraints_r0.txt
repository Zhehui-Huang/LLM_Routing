- [There are 16 cities represented with specific coordinates, including a depot city.]
- [Each robot must start and end its tour at the depot city.]
- [All cities, except the depot, must be visited exactly once by the collective group of robots.]
- [The objective is to minimize the total travel cost, which is the sum of the Euclidean distances traveled by all robots.]
- [There are 8 robots available for completing the tours.]
- [Travel cost is calculated using the Euclidean distance formula between two cities.]
