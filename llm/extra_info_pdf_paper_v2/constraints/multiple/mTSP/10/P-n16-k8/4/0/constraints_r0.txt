- [Requirement 1] There are 16 cities including the depot city. Each city is identified uniquely by an index and has specific coordinates.
- [Requirement 2] There are 8 robots, and all robots start and end their tours at the depot city (City 0).
- [Requirement 3] Each robot can travel between any two cities, and the travel cost is calculated as the Euclidean distance between the cities.
- [Requirement 4] Every city, except the depot, must be visited exactly once by any of the robots.
- [Requirement 5] The objective is to find tours for each robot that minimize the total cumulative travel cost while ensuring each city is visited once and robots return to the depot.
- [Requirement 6] Output format should list each robotâ€™s tour as starting and ending at the depot city, show the travel cost for each tour, and provide the overall cumulative travel cost for all tours.
