- [Requirement 1] There are 21 cities with known coordinates, including a depot city (city 0).
- [Requirement 2] Two robots must be used to solve the problem, both starting and ending at the depot.
- [Requirement 3] Each city, except for the depot, must be visited exactly once by the robots collectively.
- [Requirement 4] Travel cost is calculated as the Euclidean distance between any two cities.
- [Requirement 5] The objective is to minimize the total travel cost of all robots.
- [Requirement 6] Tours must start and end at the depot city.
- [Requirement 7] Output the tours for each robot as a list of city indices.
- [Requirement 8] Output should include the total travel cost for each robot's tour, and an overall total travel cost.
