- [Requirement 1] There are 21 cities, each represented with unique coordinates; robots need to visit all these cities starting and ending at the depot city.
- [Requirement 2] All robots (2 in this scenario) start and end their journey at the depot city.
- [Requirement 3] Travel costs between cities are calculated using the Euclidean distance formula.
- [Requirement 4] Each robot must visit each city exactly once, except for the depot city.
- [Requirement 5] The objective is to minimize the total travel cost across all robots.
- [Requirement 6] The final output should list tours for each robot beginning and ending at the depot, the total travel cost for each tour, and the combined total travel cost.
