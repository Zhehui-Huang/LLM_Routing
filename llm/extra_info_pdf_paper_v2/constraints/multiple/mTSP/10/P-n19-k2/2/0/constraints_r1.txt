- [Requirement 1] There are 19 cities, indexed from 0 to 18, with specific coordinates provided. Robots start and end their tours at the depot city 0.
- [Requirement 2] Two robots are used, both starting from the depot. They must collectively visit all non-depot cities exactly once and then return to the depot.
- [Requirement 3] The objective is to minimize the total travel cost, which is calculated as the Euclidean distance between cities. The travel cost for each tour and the combined total travel cost for all tours should be minimized.
