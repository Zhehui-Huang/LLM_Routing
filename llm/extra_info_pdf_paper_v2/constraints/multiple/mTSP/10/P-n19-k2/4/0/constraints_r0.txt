- [Requirement 1] There are 19 cities including the depot; each city (except the depot) must be visited exactly once by the robots, and all tours must start and end at the depot city.
- [Requirement 2] Two robots are available for the task, and they must collectively cover all cities, excluding the depot, exactly once in total.
- [Requirement 3] The objective is to minimize the total travel cost, which is computed as the sum of the Euclidean distances between the cities each robot visits, including the return to the depot.
