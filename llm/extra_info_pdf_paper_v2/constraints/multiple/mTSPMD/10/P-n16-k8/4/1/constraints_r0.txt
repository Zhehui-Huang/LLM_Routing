- [Requirement 1] There are 16 cities including 8 depots, each designated for a specific robot.
- [Requirement 2] Each of the 8 robots starts and ends its tour at its assigned depot city.
- [Requirement 3] Robots must collectively visit all cities exactly once and then return to their respective depots.
- [Requirement 4] The objective is to determine the shortest possible tours for each robot while minimizing the total travel cost for all robots.
- [Requirement 5] Travel costs between cities are calculated using the Euclidean distance.
- [Requirement 6] Output the tours for each robot in the form of a list of city indices, starting and ending at its assigned depot.
- [Requirement 7] Output the total travel cost for each robot's tour and the overall total travel cost for all tours combined.
- [Requirement 8] Use insights from an Ant Colony System (ACS) approach as proposed in the referenced research for solving this problem.
- [Requirement 9] Implement modifications to traditional ACS to handle the multiple depots and fixed endpoints, including custom transition probabilities and pheromone updates based on this mechanistic specificity.
- [Requirement 10] Each solution must ensure the avoidance of local optima and encourage convergence toward optimal solutions through dynamic pheromone updates and evaporation mechanisms.
