- [Requirement 1] There are 16 cities (including 8 depots), and each robot must start and end at its assigned depot.
- [Requirement 2] Each city must be visited exactly once by any one of the 8 robots.
- [Requirement 3] Objective is to minimize the total travel cost for all robots, which is calculated using the Euclidean distance between cities.
- [Requirement 4] The solution must return detailed tours for each robot from their respective starting depots and back to the same depots.
- [Requirement 5] Output should include individual tour descriptions (path and cost) for each robot, and compute an overall total travel cost.
