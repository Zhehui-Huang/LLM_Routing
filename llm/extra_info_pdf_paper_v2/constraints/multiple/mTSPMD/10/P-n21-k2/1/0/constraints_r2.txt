- [There are 21 cities with specified coordinates, including two depots.]
- [Each robot must start and end its tour at its designated depot.]
- [The robots must collectively visit each city exactly once.]
- [The goal is to minimize the total travel cost for all robots combined.]
- [Travel cost is calculated as the Euclidean distance between two cities.]
- [Two robots are available, and each robot's starting and ending coordinates are fixed.]
- [City indices are used to define tours and identify locations.]
- [The tours for each robot should be printed as a list of city indices, beginning and ending at the respective depot city.]
- [The total cost of the tour for each individual robot and the overall cost for both robots should be calculated and displayed.]
