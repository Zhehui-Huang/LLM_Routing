- [Requirement 1] There are 19 cities with known coordinates including two depot cities: Depot 0 located at (30, 40) and Depot 1 located at (37, 52).
- [Requirement 2] There are two robots: Robot 0 starts and ends at Depot city 0, and Robot 1 starts and ends at Depot city 1.
- [Requirement 3] Travel Cost is calculated based on the Euclidean distance between two cities.
- [Requirement 4] Each robot must visit all assigned cities exactly once and then return to its respective depot, ensuring no city is visited more than once across all robots.
- [Requirement 5] The solution should minimize the total combined travel cost of both robots' tours.
- [Requirement 6] The output must include the tour for each robot starting and ending at the assigned depot and the total travel cost for each tour, along with the overall total travel cost.
