- [Requirement 1] There are 19 cities including two depot cities. Each robot must start and end at its assigned depot: Robot 0 starts and ends at depot city 0, and Robot 1 starts and ends at depot city 1.
- [Requirement 2] Each city (including depots) must be visited exactly once by the robots collectively, ensuring every city is visited by one and only one robot before the robot returns to its starting depot.
- [Requirement 3] The robots' travel cost between any two cities is calculated using the Euclidean distance formula, and the objective is to minimize the total combined travel cost for all robots.
