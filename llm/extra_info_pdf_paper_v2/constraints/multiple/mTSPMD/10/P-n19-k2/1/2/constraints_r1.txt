- [Requirement 1] There are 19 cities including 2 depot cities; cities are identified with coordinates.
- [Requirement 2] There are 2 robots, each starting and ending at a designated depot.
- [Requirement 3] Robots must visit each city exactly once and return to their respective depots after completing their tours.
- [Requirement 4] The objective is to minimize the total travel cost for all robots combined, accounting for distances calculated as the Euclidean distance between two given cities.
- [Requirement 5] The solution output must specify the tour for each robot starting and ending at its assigned depot, and state individually the travel cost for each tour, as well as the combined total travel cost.
- [Requirement 6] The Antony Colony System (ACS) is suggested for solving this problem due to its effectiveness in dealing with multiple depots and its ability to find competitive solutions quickly.
