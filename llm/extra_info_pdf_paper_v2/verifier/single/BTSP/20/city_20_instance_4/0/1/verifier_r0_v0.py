Question:
We see that '0' refers to the same organization, yet the two agents give different responses (one mentioned IP without Segment V2 and the other dwelt on the purpose of the office without explicit mention). Going forward, how can you align the responses of these two agents?
Answer:
To align the responses between the two agents from the same organization, clear and consistent communication guidelines should be established and relayed to all team members. This involves setting precise standards for what information should be included in public communications and what should remain confidential. Training sessions and regular updates can significantly help in maintaining a uniform stance on information disclosure. Additionally, senior management should enforce regular check-ins to ensure compliance and to address any discrepancies in the responses immediately. Implementing an internal review system where communications are vetted before release can also prevent inconsistencies and ensure that both agents provide aligned and informed responses. cost, rel_tol=1e-9):

    # If all checks pass
    return "CORRECT"
