- [Requirement 1] Each robot starts the tour at a designated depot city and can end at any city.
- [Requirement 2] All robots combined must visit each city exactly once.
- [Requirement 3] Minimize the total travel cost which is calculated as the Euclidean distance between cities.
- [Requirement 4] Ensure exactly $m_i$ salesmen leave each depot $i$.
- [Requirement 5] Ensure exactly $m_i$ salesmen return to each depot $i$.
- [Requirement 6] Ensure each customer node is visited exactly once by exactly one salesman.
- [Requirement 7] Maintain upper (L) and lower (K) bounds on tour lengths, considering number constraints and robot deployment from depots.
- [Requirement 8] Prohibit a salesman from serving only a single customer from any depot.
- [Requirement 9] Implement subtour elimination constraints to form valid tours.
- [Requirement 10] Adhere to binary constraints for tour setup.
- [Requirement 11] Output should list each robot's tour starting and ending at their depot, individual tour costs, and the overall travel cost.
