- [Ensure exactly 8 salesmen leave depot city 1, and each salesman starts and possibly ends at depot city 0.]
- [Ensure that each robot visits each city exactly once, excluding their starting depot, unless necessary for route completion.]
- [Minimize the total combined travel cost for all robot tours.]
- [Ensure no tour serves only one customer node, and each tour visits at least 2 cities.]
- [Avoid subtours within each robot's tour ensuring a connected and single loop per tour.]
- [For each robot, start and end the tour at the designated depot city.]
- [Ensure that each city is visited exactly once by any of the robots.]
- [All output variables used in path determination between cities are binary.]
