- [Requirement 1] Robots need to collectively visit all cities exactly once.
- [Requirement 2] Each robot starts from a designated depot but does not need to return to the depot after completing its tour.
- [Requirement 3] Tours are optimized for the lowest total travel distance or cost.
- [Requirement 4] Ensure exactly \(m_i\) salesmen leave each depot \(i \in D\).
- [Requirement 5] Ensure exactly \(m_i\) salesmen return to each depot \(i \in D\).
- [Requirement 6] Ensure each customer node is visited exactly once.
- [Requirement 7] Prohibit a salesman from serving only a single customer.
- [Requirement 8] Subtour elimination constraints must be enforced.
- [Requirement 9] Binary constraints: \(x_{ij}\) must be either 0 or 1.
- [Requirement 10] Bound constraints to ensure proper tour lengths and initialize \(u_i\), \( 2 \leq K \leq \left\lfloor \frac{n - 1}{m} \right\rfloor \) and \(L \geq K\) are followed.
