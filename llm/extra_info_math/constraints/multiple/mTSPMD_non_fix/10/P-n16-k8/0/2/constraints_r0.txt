- [All robots must start from depot city 0.]
- [Each robot can travel between any two cities.]
- [Travel cost is calculated as the Euclidean distance between two cities.]
- [All cities must be visited exactly once by the robots collectively.]
- [Robots do not need to return to the depot after completing their tour.]
- [Objective is to minimize the total travel cost for all robots combined.]
- [Each robot's tour should start and end at its assigned depot if it returns to a depot.]
