- [Each robot must start from a designated depot.]
- [Each robot does not need to return to the depot after completing its tour.]
- [All robots must collectively visit all cities exactly once.]
- [Optimize for the shortest tours for each robot.]
- [Minimize the total travel cost for all robots combined.]
- [Travel cost is calculated as the Euclidean distance between two cities.]
