- [Each robot starts from a designated depot and does not need to return to the depot after completing its tour.]
- [All robots start at depot city 0.]
- [The goal is to determine the shortest tours for each robot while minimizing the total travel cost for all robots combined.]
- [Ensure that each city is visited exactly once and that the tours are optimized for the lowest total travel distance or cost.]
- [Ensure exactly $m_i$ salesmen leave each depot $i \in D$.]
- [Ensure exactly $m_i$ salesmen return to each depot $i \in D$.]
- [Ensure each customer node is visited exactly once by summing both entering and leaving equal to 1.]
- [Bound constraints to ensure proper tour lengths and initialize $u_i$.]
- [Prohibit a salesman from serving only a single customer.]
- [Subtour elimination constraints.]
- [Binary constraints on the travel variables $x_{ij}$.]
- [There are 22 cities including depots.]
- [Travel cost is calculated as the Euclidean distance between two cities.]
- [There are 4 robots available with their IDs starting from 0.]
- [Minimize the total cost of traveling given by the sum of costs over all used arcs in the solution $\sum_{(i, j) \in A} c_{ij} x_{ij}$.]
