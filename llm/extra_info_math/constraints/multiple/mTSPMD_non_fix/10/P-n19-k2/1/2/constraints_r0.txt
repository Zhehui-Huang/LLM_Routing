- [Requirement 1] Robots need to collectively visit all cities exactly once.
- [Requirement 2] Each robot starts from a designated depot and does not need to return to the depot after completing its tour.
- [Requirement 3] Robots can stop at any city as their endpoint.
- [Requirement 4] The goal is to determine the shortest tours for each robot while minimizing the total travel cost for all robots combined.
- [Requirement 5] Travel cost is calculated as the Euclidean distance between two cities.
- [Requirement 6] Ensure exactly $m_i$ salesmen leave each depot, and exactly $m_i$ salesmen return to each depot.
- [Requirement 7] Each customer node must be visited exactly once in the entire solution.
- [Requirement 8] Tours must obey the defined constraints on the number of nodes each salesman must visit, specified by parameters $K$ and $L$.
- [Requirement 9] There are subtour elimination constraints to ensure that all tours are valid and do not consist of disconnected parts or cycles that do not include the depot.
- [Requirement 10] The solution must result in tours starting and ending at the designated depots for each robot.
- [Requirement 11] Output the tours for each robot as a list of city indices, including the depot start and endpoints.
- [Requirement 12] Output the total travel cost for each tour and the overall total travel cost.
