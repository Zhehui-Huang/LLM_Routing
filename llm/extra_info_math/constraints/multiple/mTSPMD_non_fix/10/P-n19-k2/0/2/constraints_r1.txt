- [Each robot starts from a designated depot and visits all other cities exactly once without returning to the depot.]
- [Minimize the total travel cost across all robots.]
- [Ensure that tours are organized such that every city is visited once and only once by any of the robots.]
- [Calculate the travel cost as the Euclidean distance between any two cities.]
- [Output the tours for each robot starting and ending at their respective depots along with the cost for each tour and the total cost for all tours combined.]
