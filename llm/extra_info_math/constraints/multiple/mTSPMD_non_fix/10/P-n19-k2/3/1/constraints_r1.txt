- [Ensure exactly two salesmen leave depot city 0.]
- [Ensure exactly two salesmen return to depot city 0.]
- [Ensure each city is visited exactly once by either robot.]
- [Bound constraints to ensure proper tour lengths and initialize position variables for cities.]
- [Prohibit a robot from serving only a single customer node.]
- [Subtour elimination constraints to prevent robots from forming separate subtours within a larger tour.]
- [Binary constraints for travel variables showing whether a given route between two cities is used in the tours.]
- [Minimize the total travel cost for all tours combined, visiting each city exactly once and optimizing for the shortest path while obeying the constraints.]
