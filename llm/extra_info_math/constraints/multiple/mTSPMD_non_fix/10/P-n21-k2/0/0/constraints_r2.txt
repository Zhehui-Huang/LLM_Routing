- [Each robot starts from a designated depot and does not need to return to the depot after completing its tour.]
- [The goal is to determine the shortest tours for each robot while minimizing the total travel cost for all robots combined.]
- [Ensure that each city is visited exactly once and that the tours are optimized for the lowest total travel distance or cost.]
- [Output the tours for each robot as a list of city indices, with each tour starting and ending at its assigned depot.]
- [Output the total travel cost for each tour and the overall total travel cost.]
