- [Ensure exactly 2 salesmen leave depot city 0, and no salesman leaves depot city 1 as all salesmen start at depot city 0]
- [Each city except the depots must be visited exactly once]
- [Minimize the total travel cost by managing the traveling routes of the salesmen optimally]
- [Salesmen can end their tours at any city, not necessarily needing to return to a depot]
- [Each route or tour must adhere to the computed Euclidean distances between cities as the method of calculating travel cost]
- [The solution must include specifying the set of cities (nodes) along the travel path for each robot and their respective total and overall costs]
