- [Each robot starts from their designated depot city and does not need to return to the depot after completing its tour.]
- [Each robot must collectively visit all cities exactly once.]
- [Each robot can stop at any city as their endpoint.]
- [The solution should determine the shortest possible tours for each robot while minimizing the total travel cost for all robots combined.]
- [The travel cost between cities is calculated as the Euclidean distance.]
- [The solution should ensure that no city is visited more than once across all tours, except for the depots which are starting points.]
- [Optimize for the lowest total travel distance or cost for all robots.]
