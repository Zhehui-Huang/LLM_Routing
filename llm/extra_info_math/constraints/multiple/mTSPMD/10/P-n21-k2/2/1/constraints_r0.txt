- [Each robot must visit all cities exactly once and return to its depot]
- [Each city must be visited exactly once by a robot]
- [Minimize the total cost, calculated as the sum of the Euclidean distances between cities visited consecutively by the same robot]
- [The starting and ending point for Robot 0 must be depot city 0]
- [The starting and ending point for Robot 1 must be depot city 1]
- [The tour paths must ensure there are no sub-tours (each segment of the tour must be connected to form a single continuous path for each robot)]
