- [Each robot tours must start and end at the assigned depot]
- [Each city is visited exactly once by one robot]
- [Minimize the total travel cost across all robots]
- [The travel cost is calculated as the Euclidean distance between cities]
- [Each robot follows the path constraints given by the mathematical model]
