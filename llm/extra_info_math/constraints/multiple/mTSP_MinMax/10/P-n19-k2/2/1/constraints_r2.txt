- [Each city is visited exactly once by one salesman.]
- [Flow conservation constraints ensure each salesman must leave each visited node and enter each visited node exactly once.]
- [Each salesman must leave the depot exactly once and return to it.]
- [Subtour elimination constraints must be applied to prevent any subtours that do not include the depot.]
- [Binary constraints for assignment variables must be adhered to, ensuring they are either 0 or 1.]
- [Continuous variables for node positions must be maintained within their defined constraints.]
- [Minimize the total travel cost by minimizing the maximum distance traveled by any single robot.]
