- [Each city is visited exactly once by one robot]
- [Flow conservation constraints (each robot must leave each visited node and enter each visited node exactly once)]
- [Each robot must leave the depot exactly once]
- [Subtour elimination constraints to prevent robots from forming smaller closed loops not involving the depot]
- [Binary constraints for assignment variables specifying that travel paths are either taken or not taken]
- [Continuous variables for node positions to help in subtour elimination]
