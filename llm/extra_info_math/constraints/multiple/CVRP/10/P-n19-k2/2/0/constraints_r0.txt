- [Each robot's route must start and end at the depot city (City 0).]
- [Each city must be visited exactly once by any of the robots.]
- [The total demand on each route must not exceed the capacity of the robot.]
- [Minimize the total travel cost for all tours.]
- [Travel cost is calculated as the Euclidean distance between cities.]
