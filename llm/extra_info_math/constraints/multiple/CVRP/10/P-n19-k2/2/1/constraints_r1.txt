- [Each robot must start and end its tour at the depot city (city 0).]
- [Each city (excluding the depot) must be visited exactly once by any robot.]
- [The total demand served by each robot on its tour must not exceed the robot's capacity (160 units).]
- [Minimize the total travel cost for all tours combined, where travel cost is calculated based on the Euclidean distance between cities.]
