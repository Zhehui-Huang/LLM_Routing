- Each route must begin and end at the depot.
- Each city must be visited exactly once by the robots.
- The total demand on each route must not exceed the robot's carrying capacity of 160.
- The objective is to minimize the total travel cost for all tours.
- Each tour must fully meet the demand of each city it visits.
- Travel cost is calculated using the Euclidean distance between the cities.
- Two robots are available for routing.
- Sub-tour cycles that do not include the depot must be prevented to ensure valid routes.
