- [Each robot must start and end its route at the depot city (city 0).]
- [Each city must be visited exactly once by any one of the robots.]
- [The total demand of the cities in each robot's route must not exceed the robot's capacity of 6000.]
- [The objective is to minimize the sum of the travel costs for all routes combined.]
- [Travel cost between two cities is calculated as their Euclidean distance.]
