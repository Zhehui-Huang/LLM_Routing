- [Each robot tour must start and end at the depot city (city 0).]
- [Each city (except the depot) must be visited exactly once by the robots.]
- [The total demand on each robot's tour must not exceed the robot's carrying capacity of 6000.]
- [The objective is to minimize the total travel cost for all tours.]
- [Travel cost is calculated as the Euclidean distance between cities.]
