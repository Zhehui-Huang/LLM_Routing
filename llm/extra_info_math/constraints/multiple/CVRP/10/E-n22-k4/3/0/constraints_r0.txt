- [Each city must be visited exactly once by the robots collectively, excluding the depot city.]
- [Each route for the robots must start and end at the depot city 0.]
- [The demand of each city must be fully met and must not exceed each robot's carrying capacity of 6000 units.]
- [The objective is to minimize the total travel cost, calculated as the Euclidean distance between cities, for all robot tours.]
