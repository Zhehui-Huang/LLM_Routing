- [Each route must start and end at the depot city.]
- [Each city (excluding the depot) must be visited exactly once by any robot.]
- [The total demand on each robot's route must not exceed the robot's capacity of 160.]
- [The objective is to minimize the total travel cost for all routes combined.]
- [Travel cost is calculated using the Euclidean distance between cities.]
- [All robots start the route from the depot city (city 0).]
