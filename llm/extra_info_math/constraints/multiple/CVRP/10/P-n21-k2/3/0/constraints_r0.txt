- [Each customer city is visited exactly once by one robot.]
- [Each robot's route starts and ends at the depot city 0.]
- [The total demand on each robot's route does not exceed the robot's capacity of 160.]
- [The travel cost is calculated as the Euclidean distance between cities, and the objective is to minimize this cost across all robots.]
- [Ensure that the total demand for all cities is met by the collective effort of both robots.]
- [Avoid sub-tours within each robot's route, i.e., every route must only have one cycle that includes the depot.]
