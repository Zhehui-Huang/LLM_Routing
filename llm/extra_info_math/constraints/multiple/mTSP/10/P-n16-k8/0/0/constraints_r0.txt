- [Requirement 1] Each city, except the depot, is to be visited exactly once by any one of the robots. Each robot starts and ends its tour at the depot.
- [Requirement 2] Minimize the total travel cost for all robots, calculated as the sum of Euclidean distances travelled in each robot's tour.
- [Requirement 3] Tours should prevent subtours that do not include the depot and ensure flow conservation, where each robot that enters a city leaves it once, unless it's the depot where it should end the tour as well.
