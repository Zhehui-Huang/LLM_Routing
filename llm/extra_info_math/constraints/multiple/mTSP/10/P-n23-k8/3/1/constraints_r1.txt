- [Each city is visited exactly once by one salesman.]
- [Flow conservation constraints must be maintained, ensuring each salesman leaves and enters each visited node exactly once.]
- [Each salesman must leave the depot exactly once and return to it after completing their tour.]
- [Subtour elimination must be enforced to prevent any salesman from making smaller loops separate from the main tour.]
- [Assignment variables indicating travel between cities by each salesman are binary (either 0 or 1).]
- [Continuous variables for node positions in the tour are non-negative.]
