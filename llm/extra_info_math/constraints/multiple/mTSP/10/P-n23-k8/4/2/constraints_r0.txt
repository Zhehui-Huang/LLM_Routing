- [Each city is visited exactly once by one salesman.]
- [Each salesman must leave and enter each visited node exactly once (Flow conservation).]
- [Each salesman must leave the depot exactly once and return to it after the tours.]
- [Subtour elimination must be enforced to avoid multiple disjoint subtours within each tour.]
- [Binary constraints are in place for assignment variables to ensure paths are correctly determined.]
- [Continuous variables for node positions should be maintained to assist in subtour elimination.]
