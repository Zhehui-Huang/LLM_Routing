- [Each city is visited exactly once by one salesman: For each city \( j \) from 1 to \( n \), the sum of all \( x_{ijk} \) across all cities \( i \) and all salesmen \( k \) is equal to 1.]
- [Flow conservation constraints: Each salesman \( k \) must leave each visited node \( p \) exactly once and enter each visited node \( p \) exactly once, ensuring that for every node \( p \) and every salesman \( k \), the total number of times they enter \( p \) minus the total number of times they leave \( p \) is zero.]
- [Each salesman must leave the depot exactly once: For the depot node \( i = 1 \) and each salesman \( k \), the sum of \( x_{1jk} \) over all nodes \( j \) must equal to 1.]
- [Subtour elimination constraints: For all pairs of nodes \( i \) and \( j \) where \( i \neq j \) and \( i \), \( j \) range from 2 to \( n \), the position variable \( u_i \) minus \( u_j \) plus \( n \) times the sum over all salesmen \( k \) of \( x_{ijk} \) must be less than or equal to \( n - 1 \).]
- [Binary constraints for assignment variables: The variable \( x_{ijk} \), representing whether salesman \( k \) travels directly from node \( i \) to node \( j \), must be either 0 or 1, for all cities \( i \), \( j \), and all salesmen \( k \).]
- [Continuous variables for node positions: The position variable \( u_i \), representing the ordinal position of node \( i \) in the tour, must be non-negative for \( i \) from 2 to \( n \).]
