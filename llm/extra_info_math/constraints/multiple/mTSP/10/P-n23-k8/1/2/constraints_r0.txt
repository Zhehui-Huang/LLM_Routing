- [Each city is visited exactly once by one salesman.]
- [Flow conservation constraints ensure each salesman must leave each visited node and enter each visited node exactly once.]
- [Each salesman must leave the depot exactly once and eventually return.]
- [Subtour elimination constraints must be used to prevent any salesman from forming smaller loops among the cities, ensuring a valid overall tour.]
- [Assignment variables for whether a salesman travels from city i to city j must be binary (either 0 or 1).]
- [Continuous variables for the position of each node in the tour sequence must be non-negative.]
