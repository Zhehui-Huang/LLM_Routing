- [Requirement 1] The robot must start at the depot city 0, visit exactly one city from each group, and return to the depot city 0.
- [Requirement 2] The tour should minimize the total travel cost, which is calculated as the Euclidean distance between consecutive cities visited.
- [Requirement 3] The tour must maintain a valid flow, meaning that there should be adequate incoming and outgoing edges for each city visited, ensuring the formation of a continuous and singular loop, without any sub-tours or disconnected sections.
