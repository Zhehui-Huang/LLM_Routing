- [There are 10 cities including the depot city with given coordinates.]
- [One robot needs to visit each city exactly once, starting and ending at the depot city 0.]
- [The robot can travel between any two cities.]
- [The travel cost is calculated as the Euclidean distance between the two cities.]
- [The goal is to minimize the longest distance between any two consecutive cities in the tour.]
- [The output should consist of the resulting tour as a list of city indices, starting and ending with the depot city 0, the total travel cost of the tour, and the maximum distance between any two consecutive cities.]
