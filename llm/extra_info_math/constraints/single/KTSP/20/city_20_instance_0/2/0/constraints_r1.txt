- [Robot must precisely visit 4 cities out of the possible 20 cities.]
- [The travel cost between any two cities is calculated using the Euclidean distance formula, making the route cost the sum of these distances.]
- [Objective is to find the shortest possible tour that satisfies the above conditions.]
- [Output the tour as a list starting and ending at the depot (city 0), and include the associated total travel cost.]
