- [The robot must start and end the tour at depot city 0.]
- [The robot must visit all other cities (1 to 9) exactly once.]
- [The total route traveled must be the shortest possible path visiting all cities exactly once and returning to the depot.]
- [Travel cost is calculated using the Euclidean distance between the cities.]
- [The problem should be solved using an integer programming formulation that minimizes the travel cost subject to constraints of entering and leaving each city exactly once, and eliminates all subtours within the solution.]
