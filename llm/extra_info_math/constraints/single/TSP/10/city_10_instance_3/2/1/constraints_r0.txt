- [The robot must start and end the tour at the depot city 0.]
- [The robot must visit each city exactly once, except the depot city.]
- [The total travel cost of the tour must be minimized.]
- [The travel cost between two cities is calculated using the Euclidean distance.]
- [The solution must ensure no subtours are formed within the tour.]
