- [The robot starts at depot city 0 and must return to it after visiting all other cities.]
- [Each city, excluding the depot, must be visited exactly once.]
- [The travel cost is calculated using the Euclidean distance between cities.]
- [The solution should minimize the total travel cost.]
- [The output should include a list indicating the tour's sequence of cities, starting and ending at the depot city 0.]
- [The output should also state the total travel cost of the tour.]
