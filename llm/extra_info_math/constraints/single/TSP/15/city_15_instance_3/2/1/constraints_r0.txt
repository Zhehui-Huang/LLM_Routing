- [The robot must start and end the tour at the depot city (0).]
- [The robot must visit all other cities exactly once.]
- [The travel cost should be calculated as the Euclidean distance between cities.]
- [The objective is to minimize the total travel cost of the tour.]
- [No subtours should be formed; the tour should form a single loop visiting all cities and returning to the depot.]
