- [The robot must start and finish its tour at the depot city 0.]
- [The robot must visit all cities exactly once, except for the depot city.]
- [The travel cost between any two cities is calculated as the Euclidean distance.]
- [The total tour cost should minimize the sum of the travel costs between consecutive cities visited, including the return to the depot.]
- [No subtours should be formed; each set of cities \(S\) should have edge connections less than the number of cities in \(S\).]
