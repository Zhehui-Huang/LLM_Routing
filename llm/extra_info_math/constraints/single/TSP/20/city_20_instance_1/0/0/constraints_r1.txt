- [The robot must start and end its tour at depot city 0.]
- [All cities, from 1 to 19, must be visited exactly once by the robot.]
- [Each city can only be left and entered exactly once.]
- [The tour must not contain any subtours among cities, that is, every subset of cities larger than one and smaller than total number of cities must be connected in such a way that they do not form an isolated loop detached from the tour.]
- [Travel cost between any two cities is calculated using the Euclidean distance between them.]
