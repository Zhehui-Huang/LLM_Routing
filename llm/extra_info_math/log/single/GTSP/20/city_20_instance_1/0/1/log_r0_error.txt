Problem MODEL has 370 rows, 399 columns and 1824 elements
Coin0008I MODEL read with 0 errors
Option for timeMode changed from cpu to elapsed
Continuous objective value is 238.672 - 0.00 seconds
Cgl0004I processed model has 370 rows, 399 columns (380 integer (380 of which binary)) and 1824 elements
Cbc0038I Initial state - 0 integers unsatisfied sum - 0
Cbc0038I Solution found of 238.672
Cbc0038I Relaxing continuous gives 238.672
Cbc0038I Before mini branch and bound, 380 integers at bound fixed and 19 continuous
Cbc0038I Mini branch and bound did not improve solution (0.00 seconds)
Cbc0038I After 0.00 seconds - Feasibility pump exiting with objective of 238.672 - took 0.00 seconds
Cbc0012I Integer solution of 238.67198 found by feasibility pump after 0 iterations and 0 nodes (0.00 seconds)
Cbc0001I Search completed - best objective 238.671981197202, took 0 iterations and 0 nodes (0.00 seconds)
Cbc0035I Maximum depth 0, 0 variables fixed on reduced cost
Cuts at root node changed objective from 238.672 to 238.672
Probing was tried 0 times and created 0 cuts of which 0 were active after adding rounds of cuts (0.000 seconds)
