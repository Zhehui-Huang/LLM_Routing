Problem MODEL has 352 rows, 399 columns and 1786 elements
Coin0008I MODEL read with 0 errors
Option for timeMode changed from cpu to elapsed
Continuous objective value is 37.4228 - 0.00 seconds
Cgl0004I processed model has 352 rows, 369 columns (350 integer (350 of which binary)) and 1726 elements
Cbc0038I Initial state - 0 integers unsatisfied sum - 0
Cbc0038I Solution found of 37.4228
Cbc0038I Relaxing continuous gives 37.4228
Cbc0038I Before mini branch and bound, 350 integers at bound fixed and 16 continuous
Cbc0038I Mini branch and bound did not improve solution (0.00 seconds)
Cbc0038I After 0.00 seconds - Feasibility pump exiting with objective of 37.4228 - took 0.00 seconds
