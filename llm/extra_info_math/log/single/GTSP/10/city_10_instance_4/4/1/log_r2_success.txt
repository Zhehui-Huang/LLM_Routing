Problem MODEL has 20 rows, 94 columns and 184 elements
Coin0008I MODEL read with 0 errors
Option for timeMode changed from cpu to elapsed
Continuous objective value is 148.104 - 0.00 seconds
Cgl0004I processed model has 20 rows, 60 columns (56 integer (56 of which binary)) and 120 elements
Cbc0038I Initial state - 0 integers unsatisfied sum - 0
Cbc0038I Solution found of 148.104
Cbc0038I Relaxing continuous gives 148.104
Cbc0038I Before mini branch and bound, 56 integers at bound fixed and 4 continuous
Cbc0038I Mini branch and bound did not improve solution (0.00 seconds)
Cbc0038I After 0.00 seconds - Feasibility pump exiting with objective of 148.104 - took 0.00 seconds
Cbc0012I Integer solution of 148.10424 found by feasibility pump after 0 iterations and 0 nodes (0.00 seconds)
Cbc0001I Search completed - best objective 148.10423709766, took 0 iterations and 0 nodes (0.00 seconds)
Cbc0035I Maximum depth 0, 0 variables fixed on reduced cost
Cuts at root node changed objective from 148.104 to 148.104
Probing was tried 0 times and created 0 cuts of which 0 were active after adding rounds of cuts (0.000 seconds)
