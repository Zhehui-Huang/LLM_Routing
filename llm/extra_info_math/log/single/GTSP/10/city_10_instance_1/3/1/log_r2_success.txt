Problem MODEL has 17 rows, 90 columns and 300 elements
Coin0008I MODEL read with 0 errors
Option for timeMode changed from cpu to elapsed
Continuous objective value is 35.828 - 0.00 seconds
Cgl0004I processed model has 17 rows, 90 columns (90 integer (90 of which binary)) and 300 elements
Cbc0038I Initial state - 0 integers unsatisfied sum - 0
Cbc0038I Solution found of 35.828
Cbc0038I Before mini branch and bound, 90 integers at bound fixed and 0 continuous
Cbc0038I Mini branch and bound did not improve solution (0.00 seconds)
Cbc0038I After 0.00 seconds - Feasibility pump exiting with objective of 35.828 - took 0.00 seconds
Cbc0012I Integer solution of 35.827996 found by feasibility pump after 0 iterations and 0 nodes (0.00 seconds)
Cbc0001I Search completed - best objective 35.82799573687, took 0 iterations and 0 nodes (0.00 seconds)
Cbc0035I Maximum depth 0, 0 variables fixed on reduced cost
Cuts at root node changed objective from 35.828 to 35.828
