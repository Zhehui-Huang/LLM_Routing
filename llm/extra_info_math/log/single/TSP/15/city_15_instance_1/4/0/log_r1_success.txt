Problem MODEL has 16399 rows, 210 columns and 745892 elements
Coin0008I MODEL read with 0 errors
Option for timeMode changed from cpu to elapsed
Continuous objective value is 355.524 - 0.07 seconds
Cgl0004I processed model has 16399 rows, 210 columns (210 integer (210 of which binary)) and 745892 elements
Cbc0038I Initial state - 0 integers unsatisfied sum - 0
Cbc0038I Solution found of 355.524
Cbc0038I Before mini branch and bound, 210 integers at bound fixed and 0 continuous
