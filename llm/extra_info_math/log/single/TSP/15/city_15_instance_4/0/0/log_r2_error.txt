Problem MODEL has 32781 rows, 210 columns and 1720530 elements
Coin0008I MODEL read with 0 errors
Option for timeMode changed from cpu to elapsed
Continuous objective value is 288.524 - 0.12 seconds
Cgl0004I processed model has 32781 rows, 210 columns (210 integer (210 of which binary)) and 1720530 elements
Cbc0038I Initial state - 0 integers unsatisfied sum - 0
Cbc0038I Solution found of 288.524
Cbc0038I Before mini branch and bound, 210 integers at bound fixed and 0 continuous
Cbc0038I Mini branch and bound did not improve solution (1.26 seconds)
Cbc0038I After 1.26 seconds - Feasibility pump exiting with objective of 288.524 - took 0.15 seconds
