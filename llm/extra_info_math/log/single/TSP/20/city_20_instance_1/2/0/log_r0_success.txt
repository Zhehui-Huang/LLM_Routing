Problem MODEL has 524308 rows, 380 columns and 44827384 elements
Coin0008I MODEL read with 0 errors
Option for timeMode changed from cpu to elapsed
Continuous objective value is 376.935 - 4.70 seconds
Cgl0004I processed model has 524308 rows, 380 columns (380 integer (380 of which binary)) and 44827384 elements
Cbc0038I Initial state - 0 integers unsatisfied sum - 0
Cbc0038I Solution found of 376.935
Cbc0038I Before mini branch and bound, 380 integers at bound fixed and 0 continuous
