Problem MODEL has 46 rows, 506 columns and 1012 elements
Coin0008I MODEL read with 0 errors
Option for timeMode changed from cpu to elapsed
Continuous objective value is 151.201 - 0.00 seconds
Cgl0004I processed model has 46 rows, 506 columns (506 integer (506 of which binary)) and 1012 elements
Cbc0038I Initial state - 0 integers unsatisfied sum - 0
Cbc0038I Solution found of 151.201
Cbc0038I Before mini branch and bound, 506 integers at bound fixed and 0 continuous
Cbc0038I Mini branch and bound did not improve solution (0.01 seconds)
Cbc0038I After 0.01 seconds - Feasibility pump exiting with objective of 151.201 - took 0.00 seconds
