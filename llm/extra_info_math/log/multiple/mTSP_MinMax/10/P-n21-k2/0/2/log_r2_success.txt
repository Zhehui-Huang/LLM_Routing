Problem MODEL has 824 rows, 900 columns and 4800 elements
Coin0008I MODEL read with 0 errors
Option for timeMode changed from cpu to elapsed
Continuous objective value is 44.0832 - 0.00 seconds
Cgl0004I processed model has 824 rows, 880 columns (860 integer (860 of which binary)) and 4780 elements
Cbc0038I Initial state - 0 integers unsatisfied sum - 0
Cbc0038I Solution found of 44.0832
Cbc0038I Relaxing continuous gives 44.0832
Cbc0038I Before mini branch and bound, 840 integers at bound fixed and 40 continuous
Cbc0038I Mini branch and bound did not improve solution (0.01 seconds)
Cbc0038I After 0.01 seconds - Feasibility pump exiting with objective of 44.0832 - took 0.00 seconds
