Problem MODEL has 98 rows, 1920 columns and 4776 elements
Coin0008I MODEL read with 0 errors
Option for timeMode changed from cpu to elapsed
Continuous objective value is 53.975 - 0.00 seconds
Cgl0004I processed model has 98 rows, 1682 columns (1682 integer (1682 of which binary)) and 4418 elements
Cbc0038I Initial state - 0 integers unsatisfied sum - 0
Cbc0038I Solution found of 53.975
Cbc0038I Before mini branch and bound, 1664 integers at bound fixed and 18 continuous
Cbc0038I Mini branch and bound did not improve solution (0.02 seconds)
Cbc0038I After 0.02 seconds - Feasibility pump exiting with objective of 53.975 - took 0.00 seconds
