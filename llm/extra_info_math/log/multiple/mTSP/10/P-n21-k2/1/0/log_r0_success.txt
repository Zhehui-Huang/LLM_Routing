Option for timeMode changed from cpu to elapsed
Continuous objective value is 44.0832 - 0.00 seconds
Cgl0004I processed model has 406 rows, 879 columns (860 integer (860 of which binary)) and 3868 elements
Cbc0038I Initial state - 0 integers unsatisfied sum - 0
Cbc0038I Solution found of 44.0832
Cbc0038I Relaxing continuous gives 44.0832
Cbc0038I Before mini branch and bound, 840 integers at bound fixed and 39 continuous
Cbc0038I Mini branch and bound did not improve solution (0.01 seconds)
