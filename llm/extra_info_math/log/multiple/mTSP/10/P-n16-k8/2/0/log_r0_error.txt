Problem MODEL has 1839 rows, 2063 columns and 11040 elements
Coin0008I MODEL read with 0 errors
Option for timeMode changed from cpu to elapsed
Continuous objective value is 326.118 - 0.00 seconds
Cgl0004I processed model has 1839 rows, 1950 columns (1935 integer (1935 of which binary)) and 10935 elements
Cbc0038I Initial state - 0 integers unsatisfied sum - 0
Cbc0038I Solution found of 326.118
Cbc0038I Relaxing continuous gives 326.118
Cbc0038I Before mini branch and bound, 1920 integers at bound fixed and 30 continuous
Cbc0038I Mini branch and bound did not improve solution (0.02 seconds)
Cbc0038I After 0.02 seconds - Feasibility pump exiting with objective of 326.118 - took 0.00 seconds
Cbc0012I Integer solution of 326.11793 found by feasibility pump after 0 iterations and 0 nodes (0.02 seconds)
Cbc0001I Search completed - best objective 326.11793237908, took 0 iterations and 0 nodes (0.02 seconds)
Cbc0035I Maximum depth 0, 0 variables fixed on reduced cost
Cuts at root node changed objective from 326.118 to 326.118
Probing was tried 0 times and created 0 cuts of which 0 were active after adding rounds of cuts (0.000 seconds)
