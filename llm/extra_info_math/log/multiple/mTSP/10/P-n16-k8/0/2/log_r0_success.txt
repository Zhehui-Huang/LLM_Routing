Problem MODEL has 1831 rows, 2055 columns and 10800 elements
Coin0008I MODEL read with 0 errors
Option for timeMode changed from cpu to elapsed
Continuous objective value is 326.118 - 0.00 seconds
Cgl0004I processed model has 1831 rows, 1950 columns (1935 integer (1935 of which binary)) and 10695 elements
Cbc0038I Initial state - 0 integers unsatisfied sum - 0
Cbc0038I Solution found of 326.118
Cbc0038I Relaxing continuous gives 326.118
Cbc0038I Before mini branch and bound, 1920 integers at bound fixed and 30 continuous
Cbc0038I Mini branch and bound did not improve solution (0.01 seconds)
Cbc0038I After 0.01 seconds - Feasibility pump exiting with objective of 326.118 - took 0.00 seconds
