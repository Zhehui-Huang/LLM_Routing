Problem MODEL has 3902 rows, 4246 columns and 23056 elements
Coin0008I MODEL read with 0 errors
Option for timeMode changed from cpu to elapsed
Continuous objective value is 235.673 - 0.01 seconds
Cgl0004I processed model has 3902 rows, 4092 columns (4070 integer (4070 of which binary)) and 22902 elements
Cbc0038I Initial state - 0 integers unsatisfied sum - 0
Cbc0038I Solution found of 235.673
Cbc0038I Relaxing continuous gives 235.673
Cbc0038I Before mini branch and bound, 4048 integers at bound fixed and 44 continuous
Cbc0038I Mini branch and bound did not improve solution (0.04 seconds)
Cbc0038I After 0.05 seconds - Feasibility pump exiting with objective of 235.673 - took 0.01 seconds
