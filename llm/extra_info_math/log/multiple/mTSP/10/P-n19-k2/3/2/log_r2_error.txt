Problem MODEL has 672 rows, 740 columns and 3960 elements
Coin0008I MODEL read with 0 errors
Option for timeMode changed from cpu to elapsed
Continuous objective value is 51.8681 - 0.00 seconds
Cgl0004I processed model has 672 rows, 720 columns (702 integer (702 of which binary)) and 3942 elements
Cbc0038I Initial state - 0 integers unsatisfied sum - 0
Cbc0038I Solution found of 51.8681
Cbc0038I Relaxing continuous gives 51.8681
Cbc0038I Before mini branch and bound, 684 integers at bound fixed and 36 continuous
Cbc0038I Mini branch and bound did not improve solution (0.01 seconds)
Cbc0038I After 0.01 seconds - Feasibility pump exiting with objective of 51.8681 - took 0.00 seconds
