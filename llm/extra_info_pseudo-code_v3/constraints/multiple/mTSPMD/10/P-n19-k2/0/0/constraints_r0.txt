- [There are 19 cities including two depots.]
- [Cities have specific coordinates for each.]
- [There are two robots (salesmen), and each robot starts and ends at its assigned depot (Robot 0 at Depot city 0, Robot 1 at Depot city 1).]
- [Robots can travel between any two cities.]
- [Travel cost is calculated as the Euclidean distance between two cities.]
- [Each robot must visit all assigned cities exactly once and return to their respective depots.]
- [Objective is to determine the shortest possible tours for each robot while minimizing the total travel cost for all robots combined.]
