- [There are 22 cities, including 4 depot cities.]
- [Each robot must start and end its tour at its assigned depot city.]
- [Robots must collectively visit all cities exactly once.]
- [Travel cost is calculated as the Euclidean distance between cities.]
- [The objective is to minimize the total combined travel cost for all robots.]
- [Each city can only be visited by one robot, ensuring no city is visited more than once.]
- [The output should list the tours for each robot starting and ending at their respective depots, the travel cost for each tour, and the overall total travel cost.]
- [Travel capability allows robots to travel between any two cities.]
