- [There are 22 cities, each specified with unique coordinates.]
- [Four robots are available, each identified from 0 to 3.]
- [Each robot has a specific depot city as its start and end location: Robot 0 starts and ends at depot city 0, Robot 1 at depot city 1, Robot 2 at depot city 2, and Robot 3 at depot city 3.]
- [Robots can travel between any two cities.]
- [Travel cost is calculated based on the Euclidean distance between cities.]
- [Each robot must visit a set of cities exactly once, ensuring all cities are visited exactly once collectively by all robots.]
- [At the end of their tour, each robot must return to its respective starting depot.]
- [The objective is to minimize the total travel cost for all robots combined.]
- [The output should be the tours for each robot starting and ending at their respective depots, and include the total travel cost for each tour and the combined total travel cost.]
