- [The problem involves 22 cities, with four depots and 18 regular cities.]
- [Each city must be visited exactly once by the robots.]
- [Each robot starts and ends at its assigned depot.]
- [There are four robots, each assigned to one of the depots.]
- [The travel cost between any two cities is the Euclidean distance between them.]
- [The objective is to determine the shortest possible tours for each robot to minimize the total travel cost for all robots combined.]
