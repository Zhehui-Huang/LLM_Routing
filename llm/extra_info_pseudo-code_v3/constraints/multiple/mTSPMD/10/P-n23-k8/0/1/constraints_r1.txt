- [Each robot must start and end its tour at its assigned depot.]
- [Each city must be visited exactly once by the robots collectively.]
- [The travel cost is calculated using the Euclidean distance between cities.]
- [The objective is to minimize the total travel cost for all robots combined while adhering to the tour constraints.]
