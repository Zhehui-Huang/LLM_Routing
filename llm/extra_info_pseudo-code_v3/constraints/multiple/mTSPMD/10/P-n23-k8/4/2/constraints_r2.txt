- [There are 23 cities with specified coordinates, including 8 depot cities.]
- [There are 8 robots, each uniquely assigned to start and end at one of the 8 depot cities.]
- [Each robot must visit cities exactly once and return to its respective depot.]
- [The goal is to minimize the total combined travel cost of all robots.]
- [Travel costs between two cities are calculated using the Euclidean distance.]
- [Each city must be visited exactly once by exactly one robot.]
- [The output should list the tour for each robot, including the cities visited in sequence starting and ending at the robot's assigned depot.]
- [The output should also provide the total travel cost for each robotâ€™s tour and the overall combined total.]
- [RobDadosot ID starts from 0 and matches with depot city index.]
- [Robots can travel between any two cities.]
