- [There are 21 cities with specified coordinates including a depot city.]
- [There are 2 robots that start and finish their tours at the depot city.]
- [Travel cost between cities is calculated as the Euclidean distance.]
- [Each city, except the depot, must be visited exactly once by the robots collectively.]
- [Objective is to minimize the maximum distance traveled by any robot.]
- [Output the tours for each robot and the total travel cost for each tour.]
- [Output the maximum travel cost among all tours.]
