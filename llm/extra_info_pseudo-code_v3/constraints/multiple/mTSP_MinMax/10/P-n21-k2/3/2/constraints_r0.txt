- [There are 21 cities including the depot city with their coordinates provided.]
- [Number of robots: 2. All robots start at depot city 0.]
- [Travel capability: Robots can travel between any two cities.]
- [Travel cost: Calculated as the Euclidean distance between two cities.]
- [Robots must collectively visit all cities exactly once, excluding the depot city as a destination, and then return to the depot after completing their tours.]
- [Each tour must start and end at the depot.]
- [The primary objective is to minimize the maximum distance traveled by any single robot.]
- [Output the tours for each robot as a list of city indices. Each tour should start and end at the depot city 0.]
- [Output the travel cost for each tour and the maximum travel cost among all tours.]
