- [There are 23 cities including a depot city (city 0).]
- [Robots must visit all cities exactly once, except the depot city, and return to the depot city.]
- [Each robot starts and ends its tour at the depot city.]
- [The objective is to minimize the maximum travel distance of any robot.]
- [Travel cost between cities is calculated using the Euclidean distance.]
- [There are 8 robots in total.]
- [Output should include the tour for each robot starting and ending at city 0, the travel cost for each tour, and the maximum travel cost among all tours.]
