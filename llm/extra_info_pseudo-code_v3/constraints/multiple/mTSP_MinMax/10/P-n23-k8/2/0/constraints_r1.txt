- [There are 23 cities with given coordinates.]
- [Number of robots: 8. All start and end at the depot city 0.]
- [Travel cost is the Euclidean distance between cities.]
- [Robots must collectively visit all cities exactly once, excluding the depot, and return to the depot after completing their tour.]
- [The objective is to minimize the maximum distance traveled by any single robot.]
- [Each tour should start and end at the depot city 0.]
- [Output should list the tours for each robot as a list of city indices, the travel cost for each tour, and the maximum travel cost among all tours.]
