- [There are 23 cities with predefined coordinates including a depot city 0.]
- [There are 8 robots, all starting and ending their journeys at depot city 0.]
- [Each robot must visit each city exactly once, except the depot city is not considered a destination but only a start and end point.]
- [Travel cost between cities is calculated using the Euclidean distance.]
- [The objective is to minimize the maximum distance traveled by any single robot.]
- [Each robot's tour should start and end at the depot city 0.]
- [Every city must be visited exactly once by all robots collectively, ensuring no city (except the depot) is visited more than once across all robots.]
- [Output must include tours for each robot starting and ending at the depot, travel cost for each tour and the maximum travel cost among all tours.]
