- [Requirement 1] There are 23 cities, and each city's location is defined by its coordinates.
- [Requirement 2] There are 8 robots, all starting and ending their tours at the depot city (City 0).
- [Requirement 3] Each city (except the depot) must be visited exactly once by the robots collectively.
- [Requirement 4] The travel cost between any two cities is calculated based on the Euclidean distance.
- [Requirement 5] The primary objective is to minimize the maximum distance traveled by any single robot.
- [Requirement 6] The output should list the tours for each robot starting and ending at the depot, the travel cost for each tour, and the maximum travel cost among all tours.
