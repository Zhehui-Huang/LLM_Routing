- [Requirement 3] Each robot must visit each city exactly once, except for the depot city, and return to the depot city after completing their tour.
- [Requirement 4] The primary objective is to minimize the maximum distance traveled by any single robot.
- [Requirement 5] Travel cost is calculated as the Euclidean distance between two cities.
- [Requirement 6] Output should include the tour for each robot and the total travel cost for each tour, each starting and ending at the depot.
- [Requirement 7] Output should additionally include the maximum travel cost among all robots' tours.
