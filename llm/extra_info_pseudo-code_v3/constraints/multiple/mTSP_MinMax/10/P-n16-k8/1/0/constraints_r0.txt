- [Requirement 1] The robots must collectively visit all cities exactly once, excluding the depot city as a destination, and then return to the depot city after completing their tours.
- [Requirement 2] Each robot starts and ends its tour at the depot.
- [Requirement 3] The primary objective is to minimize the maximum distance traveled by any single robot.
- [Requirement 4] There are 16 cities, including the depot city.
- [Requirement 5] Number of robots: 8. All robots start at depot city 0.
- [Requirement 6] Travel cost is calculated as the Euclidean distance between two cities.
- [Requirement 7] Output the tours for each robot as a list of city indices. Each tour should start and end at the depot city 0.
- [Requirement 8] Output the travel cost for each tour and the maximum travel cost among all tours.
- [Requirement 9] After clustering cities into groups using Fuzzy C-Means (FCM), a random greedy heuristic is applied to generate an initial solution.
- [Requirement 10] The solution is iteratively refined using Variable Neighborhood Search (VNS) with the operations 2-opt, Insert, and Swap both in inter-tour and intra-tour contexts.
- [Requirement 11] Solution adjustments involve random changes to escape local optima during the improvement stage.
- [Requirement 12] Adaptive candidate sets are used to reduce the search space for local search operations, which are dynamically adjusted based on the best solutions found.
- [Requirement 13] Each city, except the depot, must be assigned to exactly one robot's tour.
