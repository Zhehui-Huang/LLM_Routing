- [There are 19 cities, including a depot city.]
- [Each robot starts and ends its tour at the depot city 0.]
- [Robots must visit every city exactly once, excluding the depot city, and return to the depot city after completing their tours.]
- [Travel cost between any two cities is calculated as the Euclidean distance.]
- [The primary objective is to minimize the maximum distance traveled by any single robot.]
- [Output should include the tour for each robot as a list of city indices starting and ending at the depot, the travel cost for each tour, and the maximum travel cost among all tours.]
