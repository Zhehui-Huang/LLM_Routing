- [There are 19 cities, each identified by coordinates.]
- [There are 2 robots, both starting and ending their tours at the depot city (0).]
- [Robots must visit all cities exactly once, except the depot city, and return to the depot city.]
- [Travel cost between cities is calculated as the Euclidean distance.]
- [Objective is to minimize the maximum distance traveled by any single robot.]
- [Output should list the tours for each robot, starting and ending at the depot city.]
- [Output should also include the travel cost for each tour and the maximum travel cost among all tours.]
