- [There are 22 cities labeled from 0 to 21, with the depot city as city 0.]
- [Each robot starts and ends its tour at the depot city.]
- [Robots must collectively visit all cities exactly once, excluding the depot city as a destination.]
- [The primary objective is to minimize the maximum distance traveled by any single robot.]
- [Travel cost is calculated as the Euclidean distance between two cities.]
- [There are 4 robots in total.]
- [Output should include the tour for each robot as a list of city indices and the total travel cost for each tour, starting and ending at the depot city.]
- [Output should also include the maximum travel cost among all tours.]
