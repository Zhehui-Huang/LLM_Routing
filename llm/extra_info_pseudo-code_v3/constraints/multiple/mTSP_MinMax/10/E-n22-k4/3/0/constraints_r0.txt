- [There are 22 cities, each having specific coordinates.]
- [Four robots are used, each starting at the depot city 0.]
- [Robots must visit all cities exactly once, excluding the depot city as a destination, and then return to the depot city after all tours.]
- [Travel cost is calculated as the Euclidean distance between two cities.]
- [The objective is to minimize the maximum distance traveled by any single robot.]
- [Output the tours for each robot as a list of city indices, starting and ending at the depot city 0.]
- [Output the travel cost for each tour.]
- [Output the maximum travel cost among all tours.]
