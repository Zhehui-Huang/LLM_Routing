- [There are 22 cities including a depot city with given coordinates]
- [There are 4 robots, all starting and ending at the depot city]
- [Robots must visit all cities exactly once, excluding the depot city]
- [The travel cost is defined as the Euclidean distance between cities]
- [The primary goal is to minimize the maximum distance traveled by any robot]
- [The solution should output the tours for each robot, starting and ending at the depot]
- [The solution should output the travel cost for each tour and the maximum travel cost among all tours]
