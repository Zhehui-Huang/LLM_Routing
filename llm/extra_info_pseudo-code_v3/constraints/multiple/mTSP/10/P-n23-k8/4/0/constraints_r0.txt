- [There are 23 cities, including the depot city (City 0), with specified coordinates.]
- [There are 8 robots, all starting at the depot city.]
- [Robots must collectively visit all cities exactly once, excluding the depot city as a destination, and then return to the depot.]
- [The objective is to determine the shortest possible tours while minimizing the total travel cost.]
- [Travel cost between two cities is calculated using Euclidean distance.]
- [Each robot's tour must start and end at the depot city.]
- [A valid solution should ensure each city is visited exactly once by any of the robots, excluding the depot.]
- [The output format requires providing the tour and the total travel cost for each robot, and the overall total travel cost.]
