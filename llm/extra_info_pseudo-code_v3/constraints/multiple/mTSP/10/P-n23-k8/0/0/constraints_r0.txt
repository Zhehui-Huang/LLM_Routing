- [Requirement 1] Each robot must start and end its tour at the depot city (city 0).
- [Requirement 2] All cities except the depot city must be visited exactly once by the robots collectively.
- [Requirement 3] The objective is to minimize the total travel cost, which is calculated as the Euclidean distance between cities.
- [Requirement 4] Output must include each robot's tour starting and ending at the depot, the total travel cost for each robot's tour, and the overall total travel cost.
