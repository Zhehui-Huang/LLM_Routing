- [Requirement 1] Each robot must start and end its tour at the depot city (city 0).
- [Requirement 2] Each city, except the depot, must be visited exactly once by the robots collectively.
- [Requirement 3] Minimize the total travel cost for all robots, which is calculated based on the Euclidean distance between two cities.
- [Requirement 4] Output the tour for each robot as a list of city indices, starting and ending at the depot.
- [Requirement 5] Output the total travel cost for each robot tour and the overall total travel cost.
- [Requirement 6] There are 22 cities in total, listed with their coordinates.
- [Requirement 7] There are 4 robots, each starting from the depot city.
- [Requirement 8] Solution must ensure every city is visited exactly once, excluding the depot city as a destination.
- [Requirement 9] Travel between any two cities is possible for the robots.
- [Requirement 10] The Euclidean distance formula is used to calculate travel costs between cities.
