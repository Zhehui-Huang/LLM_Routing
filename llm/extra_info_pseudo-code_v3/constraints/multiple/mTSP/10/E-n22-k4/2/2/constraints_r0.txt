- [There are 22 cities including a depot city.]
- [The coordinates for each city are provided including the depot.]
- [Four robots are available for use, all starting from the depot city.]
- [Robots can travel between any two cities.]
- [Travel cost is calculated as the Euclidean distance between two cities.]
- [Each robot must start and end its tour at the depot city.]
- [Every city, except the depot, must be visited exactly once by the robots collectively.]
- [The goal is to minimize the total travel cost for all robots.]
- [Output should list the tours for each robot, starting and ending at the depot.]
- [Output should list the travel cost for each tour and the overall total travel cost.]
