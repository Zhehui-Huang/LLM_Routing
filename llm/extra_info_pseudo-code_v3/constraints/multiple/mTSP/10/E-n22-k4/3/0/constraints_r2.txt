- [There are 22 cities including the depot.]
- [All robots start at the depot city 0.]
- [Each robot must visit all cities exactly once, excluding the depot city as a destination.]
- [Each robot must return to the depot city after completing their tour.]
- [The total travel cost must be minimized.]
- [Travel cost is calculated as the Euclidean distance between two cities.]
- [The output should list each tour starting and ending at the depot city 0.]
- [The output should include the total travel cost for each robot's tour and the overall total cost.]
