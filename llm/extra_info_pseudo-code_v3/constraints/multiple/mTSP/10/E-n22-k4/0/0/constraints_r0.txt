- [There are 22 cities, including the depot city.]
- [Cities are represented by their coordinates.]
- [There are 4 robots, all starting at the depot city.]
- [Each robot must start and end its tour at the depot city.]
- [Travel cost between cities is calculated as the Euclidean distance.]
- [Each city, except the depot, must be visited exactly once by any of the robots.]
- [The objective is to minimize the total travel cost of all robots collectively.]
- [Output should provide tours for each robot starting and ending at the depot city.]
- [Output should also include the total travel cost for each tour and the overall total travel cost.]
