- [Requirement 1]: Each robot must start and end its tour at the depot city (city 0).
- [Requirement 2]: Each city, excluding the depot, must be visited exactly once collectively by all robots.
- [Requirement 3]: The travel cost is calculated as the Euclidean distance between two cities and should be minimized.
- [Requirement 4]: The output for each robot should list the tour starting and ending at depot city (city 0) and include the travel cost for each tour.
- [Requirement 5]: The output should also include the overall total travel cost for all tours combined.
