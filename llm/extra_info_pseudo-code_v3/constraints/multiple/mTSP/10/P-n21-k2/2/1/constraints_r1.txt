- [There are 21 cities, including a depot city.]
- [Each robot starts and ends its tour at the depot city.]
- [The robots must collectively visit all cities exactly once, excluding the depot city as a destination.]
- [Travel cost is calculated as the Euclidean distance between two cities.]
- [The objective is to determine the shortest possible tours for the robots while minimizing the total travel cost.]
- [Ensure that every city, except the depot, is visited exactly once.]
- [There are 2 robots, and they both start at the depot city.]
- [Output the tours for each robot, starting and ending at the depot city.]
- [Output the total travel cost for each tour and the overall total travel cost.]
