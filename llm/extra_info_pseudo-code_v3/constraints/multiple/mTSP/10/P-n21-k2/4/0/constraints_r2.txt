- [There are 21 cities, each with specified coordinates.]
- [There are 2 robots, both starting at the depot (city 0).]
- [Robots must collectively visit all cities exactly once, excluding the depot city, and return to the depot after completing their tours.]
- [Travel cost is calculated as the Euclidean distance between two cities.]
- [Each robot's tour must start and end at the depot city.]
- [The objective is to determine the shortest possible tours for the robots while minimizing the total travel cost.]
- [Output the tours for each robot as a list of city indices, starting and ending at the depot city.]
- [Output the total travel cost for each tour and the overall total travel cost.]
