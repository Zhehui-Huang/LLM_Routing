- [There are 21 cities including a depot city labeled as city 0.]
- [The coordinates for each city are provided, allowing for distance calculation.]
- [There are 2 robots, and all robots start their journey at the depot city 0.]
- [Robots must collectively visit all cities exactly once, excluding the depot city, and then return to the depot city.]
- [Travel cost between cities is calculated using Euclidean distance.]
- [The task requires minimizing the total combined travel cost for all robots.]
- [The output must consist of individual tours for each robot starting and ending at the depot city, with each city being visited exactly once by any robot.]
- [The output should include total travel cost for each tour and the overall sum of these costs.]
