- [There are 21 cities, each with specified coordinates.]
- [The environment includes a depot city labelled as city 0.]
- [There are 2 robots, both starting and ending their tours at the depot city.]
- [Each robot must visit all cities exactly once, excluding the depot city as a destination.]
- [Travel cost between cities is calculated using the Euclidean distance.]
- [The objective is to minimize the total travel cost across all robot tours.]
- [Each city must be visited exactly once by the robots collectively.]
- [Each tour must start and end at the depot city.]
- [Output format: List the tour and total travel cost for each robot and the combined total travel culture for all tours.]
