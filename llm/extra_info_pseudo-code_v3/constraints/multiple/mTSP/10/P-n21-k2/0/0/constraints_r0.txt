- [There are 21 cities, each with specified coordinates.]
- [There are 2 robots, each starting at the depot city 0.]
- [All robots must return to the depot city after completing their tours.]
- [Robots must collectively visit all cities exactly once, excluding the depot city as a destination.]
- [The task is to minimize the total travel cost, which is based on the Euclidean distance between two cities.]
- [Each tour for each robot must start and end at the depot city 0.]
- [The output must list the tour for each robot as a list of city indices starting and ending at the depot city.]
- [The output must also list the total travel cost for each tour and the overall total travel cost.]
