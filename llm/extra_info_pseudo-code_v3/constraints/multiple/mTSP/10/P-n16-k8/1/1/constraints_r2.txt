- [There are 16 cities, each with a specific set of coordinates.]
- [There are 8 robots, all starting at the depot city 0.]
- [Robots must visit each city exactly once, excluding the depot city as a destination, then return to the depot city.]
- [Travel cost is calculated using the Euclidean distance between two cities.]
- [The objective is to minimize the total travel cost for all robots while ensuring that each city, except the depot, is visited exactly once.]
- [Each robot's tour should start and end at the depot city 0.]
- [Output should include the specific tours for each robot with city indices, the total travel cost for each tour, and the combined total travel cost of all tours.]
