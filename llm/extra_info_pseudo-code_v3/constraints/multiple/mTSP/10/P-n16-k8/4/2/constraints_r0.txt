- [16 cities, including a starting depot city (city 0)]
- [8 robots, each starting and ending at the depot city]
- [Travel between any two cities is possible]
- [Travel cost is calculated using the Euclidean distance]
- [Each city, except the depot, must be visited exactly once by any one of the robots]
- [Objective is to minimize the total combined travel cost of all tours]
- [Output each robot's tour as a list of city indices, beginning and ending at the depot]
- [Output the total travel cost for each robot tour and the overall combined travel cost]
- [Use a generalized k-opt exchange procedure for improving the solution iteratively]
- [Ensure solution feasibility within the rules stated]
