- [There are 16 cities, including the Depot city 0.]
- [Each robot must start and end their tour at the depot city 0.]
- [Each city, except the depot, must be visited exactly once by the robots.]
- [There are 8 robots available for the task.]
- [Travel cost between any two cities is determined by the Euclidean distance.]
- [The objective is to find the shortest possible tours for all robots to minimize the total cumulative travel cost.]
- [Output the tours for each robot as a list of city indices starting and ending at the depot.]
- [Output the individual total travel cost for each tour and the overall total travel cost.]
