- [There are 16 cities with predefined coordinates including a depot city designated as City 0.]
- [There are 8 robots, all starting and ending their tours at the depot city.]
- [Travel capability exists between any two cities for the robots.]
- [Travel cost is computed using the Euclidean distance between two cities.]
- [Each robot must visit each city exactly once, excluding the depot as a destination, and return to the depot city after completing their tours.]
- [The task is to find the shortest possible tours for all robots while minimizing the total travel cost.]
- [Every non-depot city must be visited exactly once by any of the robots.]
- [Output the tours for each robot as a list of city indices starting and ending at the depot city.]
- [Output the travel cost for each tour and the overall total travel cost.]
