- [There are 16 cities including the depot city.]
- [City coordinates are provided for each city.]
- [There are 8 robots, all starting from the depot city 0.]
- [Each robot must start and end its tour at the depot city 0.]
- [Travel cost is calculated using the Euclidean distance between cities.]
- [Robots must collectively visit all cities exactly once, excluding the depot city, and return to the depot after completing their tours.]
- [The objective is to minimize the total travel cost across all robot tours.]
- [Each tour for each robot is to be outputted with its sequence of visited city indices starting and ending at the depot city 0.]
- [Travel cost for each individual robot's tour is to be provided.]
- [The overall total travel cost for all tours combined is to be provided.]
