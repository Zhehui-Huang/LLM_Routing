- [There are 19 cities enumerated from 0 to 18 with specified coordinates.]
- [There are 2 robots. All robots start at the depot city 0.]
- [Robots must collectively visit all cities exactly once, excluding the depot city (city 0) as a destination, and then return to the depot city after completing their tours.]
- [Travel cost between cities is calculated as the Euclidean distance between their coordinates.]
- [The objective is to determine the shortest possible tours for the robots while minimizing the total travel cost.]
- [Each robot's tour must start and end at the depot city 0.]
- [The output should include each robot's tour as a list of city indices and the total travel cost for each tour, as well as the overall total travel cost.]
