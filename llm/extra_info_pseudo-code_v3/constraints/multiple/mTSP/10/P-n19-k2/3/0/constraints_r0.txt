- [The environment contains 19 cities including a depot city (city 0).]
- [Coordinates are provided for each city.]
- [There are 2 robots starting at the depot city.]
- [Travel cost is calculated as the Euclidean distance between two cities.]
- [Robots must collectively visit all cities exactly once, excluding the depot city as a destination, and then return to the depot city.]
- [Each robot starts and ends its tour at the depot city.]
- [The main objective is to determine the shortest possible tours for the robots while minimizing the total travel cost.]
- [Tours for each robot should be output as lists starting and ending at the depot.]
- [The output should include the total travel cost for each robot's tour and the overall total travel cost.]
