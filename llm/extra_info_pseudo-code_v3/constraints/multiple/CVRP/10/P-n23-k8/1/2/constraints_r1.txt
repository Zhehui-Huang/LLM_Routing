- [There are 23 cities including the depot city (city 0), and each city has specific coordinates.]
- [Each city, excluding the city 0 (depot), has a specific demand that must be met by the delivery.]
- [There are 8 robots available for the deliveries, each with a carrying capacity of 40 units.]
- [All robots start their journey from the depot city (city 0).]
- [The robots can travel between any two cities.]
- [Travel cost among cities is calculated using the Euclidean distance formula.]
- [Each tour for every robot must start and end at the depot city (city 0).]
- [The objective is to minimize the total travel cost for all robots while ensuring the trip meets all city demands and stays within the robots' carrying capacity constraints.]
- [The output should list each robot's tour and associated total travel cost, as well as the collective total travel cost for all tours.]
