- All robots must start and end at the depot city 0.
- The demand of each city must be fully met.
- The capacity constraints of each robot, which is 40, must not be exceeded.
- Minimize the total travel cost for all tours.
- The output format should list each robot's tour starting and ending at the depot city, each tour's travel cost, and the overall total travel cost.
- Travel cost is calculated as the Euclidean distance between two cities.
