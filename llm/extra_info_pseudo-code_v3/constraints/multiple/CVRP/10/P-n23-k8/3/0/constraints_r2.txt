- [There are 23 cities including the depot city 0.]
- [Each city has a specific (x,y) coordinate.]
- [Each city has a designated demand that must be fully met by the deliveries from the robots.]
- [There are 8 robots available for deliveries.]
- [Each robot has a capacity of 40 units.]
- [All robots start and end their route at the depot city (city 0).]
- [Travel is calculated using Euclidean distance between cities.]
- [The objective is to minimize the total travel cost for all robot tours while adhering to capacity and demand constraints.]
