- [Environment: 23 cities with coordinates for each, starting from depot city 0.]
- [Demand list provided for each city including depot city.]
- [Robot Information: 8 robots, each with a capacity of 40.]
- [Travel between any two cities allowed with costs calculated using Euclidean distances.]
- [All robots start from the depot city 0.]
- [The objective is to minimize the total travel cost for all robot tours.]
- [Each robot must meet the demand of each city without exceeding its carrying capacity.]
- [All cities must be part of a tour and all tours must return to the depot city.]
- [Output tours for each robot starting and ending at the depot.]
- [Output the total travel cost for each tour and the combined total travel cost.]
- [Ensure that the provides solution is an optimal approach to solving the CVRP with Adaptive Large Neighborhood Search (ALNS) method using an iterative approach for initial solution construction and solution improvement.]
