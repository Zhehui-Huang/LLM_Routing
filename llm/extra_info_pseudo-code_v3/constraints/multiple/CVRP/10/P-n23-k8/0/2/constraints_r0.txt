- [The robots must deliver goods to all cities, excluding the depot city, and return to the depot city after completing their deliveries.]
- [Each robot has a specified maximum carrying capacity.]
- [The total demand of each city must be fully met.]
- [Minimize the total travel cost for all tours.]
- [The objective is to determine the shortest possible tours for the robots while not exceeding their capacity constraints.]
- [Travel cost is calculated as the Euclidean distance between two cities.]
