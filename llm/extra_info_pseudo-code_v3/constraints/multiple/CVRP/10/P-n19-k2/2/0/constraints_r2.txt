- [There are 19 cities, each with specific coordinates and demands that need to be met by the robots. City 0 serves as the depot.]
- [Each city needs its specified demand fully met by the deliveries.]
- [Two robots are available for making these deliveries, each with a capacity of 160 units.]
- [Robots start their route from and must return to the depot city after completing their deliveries.]
- [Travel costs between the cities are calculated using the Euclidean distance.]
- [The objective is to minimize the total cost of travel for all tours combined while respecting each robot's capacity constraints.]
