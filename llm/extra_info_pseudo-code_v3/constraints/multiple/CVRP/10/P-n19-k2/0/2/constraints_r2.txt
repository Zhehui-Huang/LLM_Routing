- [There are 19 cities including the depot city 0.]
- [The coordinates and demand for each city are specified, including zero demand for the depot city.]
- [There are 2 robots available for delivery tasks, starting from depot city 0.]
- [Each robot has a carrying capacity of 160.]
- [Travel cost between any two cities is defined by the Euclidean distance.]
- [Robots must deliver goods to all cities except the depot city, then return to the depot city.]
- [Each city's demand must be fully met by the robots.]
- [The combined capacity of the robots must not be exceeded on any tour.]
- [The objective is to minimize the total travel cost for all robot tours.]
- [Each robot's tour must start and end at the depot city 0.]
- [Output should include the complete tour for each robot, the total travel cost of that tour, and the overall total cost.]
