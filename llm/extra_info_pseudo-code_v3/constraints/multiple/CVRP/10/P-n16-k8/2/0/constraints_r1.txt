- [There are 16 cities with specified coordinates and demands, excluding the depot city.]
- [Each robot starts at the depot city 0 and must return there after completing deliveries.]
- [Each city's demand must be fully met by the deliveries.]
- [Each robot has a capacity constraint of 35 units.]
- [The travel cost is calculated based on the Euclidean distance between two cities.]
- [The objective is to minimize the total travel distance for all robot tours.]
- [The solution must ensure that no robot's carrying capacity is exceeded.]
- [All robots must collectively cover all cities.]
- [The tours output format should include each tour starting and ending at the depot city 0.]
