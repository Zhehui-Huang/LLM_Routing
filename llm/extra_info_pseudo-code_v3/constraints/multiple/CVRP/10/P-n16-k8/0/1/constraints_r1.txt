- All robots start and end their tours at the depot city (city 0).
- Each city's specified demand must be fully met.
- The carrying capacity of each robot (35 units) must not be exceeded.
- Minimize the total travel cost for all tours.
- Each tour must include only cities that collectively do not exceed the robot's carrying capacity.
- Each city (excluding the depot) must be visited exactly once across all tours.
- The travel cost is calculated as the Euclidean distance between two cities.
- The solution must report the specific routes for each robot starting and ending at the depot.
- The solution must report the total travel cost for each robot's tour and the overall travel cost.
- The number of available robots is 8.
