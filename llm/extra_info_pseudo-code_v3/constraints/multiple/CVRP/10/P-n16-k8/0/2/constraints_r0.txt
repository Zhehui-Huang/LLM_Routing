- Each robot must start and end its tour at the depot city 0.
- All cities except the depot city must be visited exactly once by the robots collectively to satisfy the delivery demands.
- The total load carried by any robot in its tour must not exceed its carrying capacity of 35.
- The travel cost for each route should be minimized. The travel cost is calculated as the Euclidean distance between two cities.
- The overall objective is to minimize the total travel cost for all tours collectively.
