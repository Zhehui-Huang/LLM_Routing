- [There are 16 cities including the depot.]
- [Each city has specific coordinates and demand, except for the depot city which has a demand of 0.]
- [There are 8 robots each with a carrying capacity of 35.]
- [All robots start their route at the depot city 0.]
- [Travel cost between cities is calculated using the Euclidean distance.]
- [Robots are required to deliver goods to each city meeting the city's demand, without exceeding their carrying capacity.]
- [Each robot's route must start and end at the depot city 0.]
- [The objective is to minimize the total travel cost for all tours.]
