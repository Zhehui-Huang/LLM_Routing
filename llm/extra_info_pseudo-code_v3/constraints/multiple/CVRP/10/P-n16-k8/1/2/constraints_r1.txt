- [There are 16 cities, each with defined coordinates and demand.]
- [There are 8 robots, each with a carrying capacity of 35.]
- [All robots start at the depot city 0.]
- [Travel cost is calculated as the Euclidean distance between two cities.]
- [Robots must deliver goods to all cities, excluding the depot city, and return to the depot city after completing their deliveries.]
- [The objective is to determine the shortest possible tours for the robots.]
- [Each city's demand must be fully met by the collective deliveries of the robots.]
- [The capacity constraints of the robots must not be exceeded.]
- [Output the tours for each robot as a list of city indices, starting and ending at the depot city 0.]
- [Output the total travel cost for each tour and the overall total travel cost.]
