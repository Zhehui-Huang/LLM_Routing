- [There are 21 cities, each with specific coordinates and demand, excluding the depot city.]
- [There are 2 robots, each with a capacity of 160.]
- [All robots start at depot city 0.]
- [Robots travel between any two cities based on Euclidean distance.]
- [Each city's demand must be fully met without exceeding robot capacities.]
- [The objective is to minimize the total travel cost for all robot tours.]
- [Each tour for each robot must start and end at the depot city 0.]
- [Output should include tours for each robot, individual tour costs, and the overall total travel cost.]
