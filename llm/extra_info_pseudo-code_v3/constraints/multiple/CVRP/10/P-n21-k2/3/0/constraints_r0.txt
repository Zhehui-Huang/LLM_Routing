- [There are 21 cities including the depot city, which are indexed from 0 to 20.]
- [The depot city has coordinates (30, 40) and a demand of 0.]
- [Each non-depot city has specific coordinates and a certain demand to be met.]
- [There are 2 robots available, each with a carrying capacity of 160.]
- [All robots start their route from the depot city and must return to the depot after completing their deliveries.]
- [The objective is to ensure that the demand of each city is fully met.]
- [The total carrying capacity of the robots must not be exceeded during their routes.]
- [Travel cost between two cities is calculated using the Euclidean distance formula.]
- [The goal is to minimize the total travel cost for all tours combined.]
- [Output should include the specific tours for each robot and the travel costs for each tour, as well as the overall total travel cost.]
