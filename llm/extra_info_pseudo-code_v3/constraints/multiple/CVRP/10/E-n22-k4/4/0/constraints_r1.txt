- [There are 22 cities including the depot city, and their coordinates are specified.]
- [Each city has a specified demand that must be met by the deliveries.]
- [The capacity of each robot is 6000 units.]
- [Travel cost between two cities is measured by the Euclidean distance.]
- [All robots start and return to the depot city 0.]
- [The robots must ensure that the demands of each city, except the depot, are fully met.]
- [The capacity constraints of the robots must not be exceeded.]
- [The objective is to minimize the total travel cost for all tours.]
