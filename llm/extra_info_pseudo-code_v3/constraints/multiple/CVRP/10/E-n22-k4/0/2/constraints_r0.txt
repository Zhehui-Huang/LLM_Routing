- [There are 22 cities, including a depot city with index 0.]
- [Each city has specific coordinates and a demand that must be met.]
- [There are 4 robots, each starting from the depot city 0.]
- [Each robot has a capacity constraint of 6000 units.]
- [All cities except the depot must have their demands fully satisfied by the robots.]
- [Robots must return to the depot city after completing their deliveries.]
- [Travel cost between cities is calculated using the Euclidean distance.]
- [The objective is to minimize the total travel cost across all robots.]
- [Tours are expected to start and end at the depot city.]
- [Each tour should not exceed the robot's carrying capacity.]
