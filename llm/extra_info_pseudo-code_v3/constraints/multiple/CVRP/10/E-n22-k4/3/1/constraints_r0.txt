- [There are 22 cities including the depot city 0.]
- [Each city has a specific demand that must be met by the deliveries.]
- [There are 4 robots available, each with a capacity of 6000.]
- [All robots start their journey from the depot city 0.]
- [Each robot's tour must start and end at the depot city 0.]
- [Robots can travel between any two cities.]
- [Travel costs are calculated based on the Euclidean distance between cities.]
- [The total capacity carried by a robot cannot exceed its maximum allowed capacity of 6000.]
- [The goal is to minimize the total travel cost for all tours while meeting city demands and adhering to robot capacity constraints.]
