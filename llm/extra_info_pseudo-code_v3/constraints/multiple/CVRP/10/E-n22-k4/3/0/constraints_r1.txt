- [There are 22 cities, including the depot city (City 0).]
- [Each city has a specific demand that must be met.]
- [There are 4 robots with a carrying capacity of 6000 each.]
- [All robots start at the depot city 0.]
- [Robots can travel between any two cities.]
- [Travel cost is calculated as the Euclidean distance between two cities.]
- [The objective is to determine the shortest possible tours for the robots.]
- [Tours for each robot must start and end at the depot city.]
- [The solution must ensure the demand of each city is fully met.]
- [The solution must ensure that the capacity constraints of the robots are not exceeded.]
- [Output should include the tours for each robot as a list of city indices.]
- [Output should include the total travel cost for each tour and the overall total travel cost.]
