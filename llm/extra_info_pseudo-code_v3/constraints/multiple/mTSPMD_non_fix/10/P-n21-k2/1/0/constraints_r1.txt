- [The task involves solving a multi-depot traveling salesman problem with 21 cities, including two depots.]
- [Each robot needs to collectively visit all cities exactly once.]
- [Each robot starts its journey from depot city 0.]
- [All cities must be visited one time across the two tours, without duplication between the robots.]
- [Robots do not need to return to their starting depots after completing their tours; they can stop at any city as their endpoint.]
- [The objective is to minimize the total travel cost for all robots combined, with travel costs calculated using the Euclidean distance between cities.]
- [Output should list the tours for each robot with starting and ending at its assigned depot, and include individual and overall total travel costs.]
