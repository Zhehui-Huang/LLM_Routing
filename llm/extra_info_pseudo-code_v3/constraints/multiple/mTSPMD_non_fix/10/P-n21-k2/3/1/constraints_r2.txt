- [There are 21 cities, each with specific coordinates.]
- [There are 2 robots starting from depot city 0.]
- [Travel between any two cities is possible for the robots.]
- [Travel cost is calculated as the Euclidean distance between two cities.]
- [Each robot needs to visit all cities exactly once collectively.]
- [Each tour should start at a designated depot for each robot.]
- [Robots do not need to return to the depot after completing their tour.]
- [Each city must be visited exactly once.]
- [The goal is to minimize the total travel cost for all robots combined.]
- [The initial solution for the optimization is generated using a Nearest Neighborhood Search (NNS).]
- [Various neighborhood structures with 2-interchange mechanisms (relocate, exchange, tail-swap, depot-exchange) are used for solution improvement.]
- [A tabu list is used to prevent cycling and encourage exploration of new solutions, managing attributes from the last 10-15 iterations.]
- [A stopping criterion is defined for terminating the search upon reaching a specified number of iterations or if no improvement is found after a certain number of iterations.]
- [An intra exchanging phase is used for further improvements within individual tours.]
- [The Tabu Search (TS) algorithm is used with a Pareto principle for the acceptance of neighbor solutions.]
- [Four types of neighborhood move operations are used for diversification and a varying tabu list length introduces further diversification.]
