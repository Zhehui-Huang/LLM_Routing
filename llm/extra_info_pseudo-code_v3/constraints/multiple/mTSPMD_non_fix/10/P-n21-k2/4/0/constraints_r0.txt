- [There are 21 cities, including two depot cities.]
- [Each robot must start from Depot city 0.]
- [Robots can travel between any two cities.]
- [Travel cost is calculated using the Euclidean distance between two cities.]
- [Robots need to collectively visit all cities exactly once.]
- [Each robot starts and ends its tour at its assigned depot.]
- [The goal is to determine the shortest tours for each robot while minimizing the total travel cost for all robots combined.]
- [Ensure that each city is visited exactly once and that the tours are optimized for the lowest total travel distance or cost.]
- [Output the tours for each robot as a list of city indices.]
- [Output the total travel cost for each tour and the overall total travel cost.]
