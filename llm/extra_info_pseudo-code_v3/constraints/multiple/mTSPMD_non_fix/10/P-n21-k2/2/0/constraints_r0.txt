- [There are 21 cities, including two depot cities (City 0 and City 1).]
- [Each robot starts at Depot City 0 and can finish at any city.]
- [The robots need to collectively visit all cities exactly once.]
- [The travel cost is calculated as the Euclidean distance between two cities.]
- [The goal is to determine the shortest possible tours for each robot while minimizing the total combined travel cost of all robots.]
- [Each tour should start at a designated depot city.]
- [The output must include the path of each robot as a list of city indices, starting and ending at its assigned depot.]
- [The output must include the travel cost for each robot's tour and the overall total travel cost.]
- [The solution should be derived using the Tabu Search algorithm with specific operations such as Nearest Neighborhood Search (NNS) for initial solution generation and various move operators (Relocate, Exchange, Tail-swap, Depot-exchange) for exploring neighborhoods.]
