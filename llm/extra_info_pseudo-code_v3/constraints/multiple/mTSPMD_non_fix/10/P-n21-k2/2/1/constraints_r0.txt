- [There are 21 cities, each with specified coordinates.]
- [Two robots are available for routing, starting from Depot city 0.]
- [Robots have the ability to travel any distance between cities.]
- [Travel cost is calculated using the Euclidean distance between cities.]
- [Each robot starts from a designated depot and ends at any city.]
- [All cities must be visited exactly once across all robots.]
- [The objective is to minimize the total combined travel cost of all robots.]
- [Use the nearest neighborhood search (NNS) to generate an initial solution.]
- [Apply neighborhood structures including relocate, exchange, tail-swap, and depot-exchange operations.]
- [Maintain a tabu list to prevent cycling and enable exploration of new areas.]
- [Stop searching after a specified number of iterations or when no improvement occurs.]
- [Use Pareto principle for selecting neighbor solutions.]
- [Incorporate an intra exchanging phase for optimizing individual tours.]
- [Output must include detailed tours and costs for each robot, and the total cost for all tours combined.]
