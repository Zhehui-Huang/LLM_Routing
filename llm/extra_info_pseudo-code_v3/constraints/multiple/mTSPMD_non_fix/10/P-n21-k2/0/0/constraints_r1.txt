- [There are 21 cities with given coordinates, including 2 depots.]
- [There are 2 robots, both start at depot city 0.]
- [Robots can travel between any two cities.]
- [Travel cost is the Euclidean distance between two cities.]
- [Each robot's tour should visit cities exactly once collectively across all robots.]
- [Each robot's tour starts from a designated depot but does not require returning to the depot.]
- [Overall goal is to minimize the total travel cost for all robots combined.]
- [A Tabu Search (TS) algorithm using nearest neighborhood search (NNS) is suggested for initial solution generation.]
- [Neighborhood structures include relocate, exchange, depot-exchange, and tail-swap operators.]
- [A tabu list is employed to prevent cycling and promote exploration.]
- [Stopping criteria involve maximum iterations or a period without improvement.]
- [Intra exchanging phase is included for solution improvement within individual tours.]
- [Pareto principle is applied for selecting non-dominated solutions.]
- [Diversification is achieved through stochastic neighborhood selection and varying tabu length.]
- [Final output should list tours for each robot starting and ending at assigned depots and contain the total travel cost for each tour and the overall cost.]
