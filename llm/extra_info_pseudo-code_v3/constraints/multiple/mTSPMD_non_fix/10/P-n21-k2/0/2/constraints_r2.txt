- [There are 21 cities with given coordinates, and each city must be visited exactly once by the robots.]
- [There are 2 robots, both starting from depot city 0.]
- [Robots can travel between any two cities, and travel cost is the Euclidean distance between cities.]
- [Each robot starts from the designated depot, needs to complete its tour, and can stop at any city as their endpoint; they do not need to return to their starting depot.]
- [The goal is to determine the shortest possible tours for each robot while minimizing the total travel cost for all robots combined.]
- [The solution must utilize a Tabu Search (TS) optimization method guided by specified move operators (Relocate, Exchange, Tail-swap, and Depot-exchange) and other mechanisms within the TS algorithm as outlined.]
- [The algorithm includes an initial solution generation using a Nearest Neighbor Search (NNS) heuristic and successive improvements through specified neighborhood structures and intra tour exchanging.]
- [The TS algorithm employs a Pareto principle for accepting neighbor solutions, ensuring they are non-dominated, and it operates under specific diversification and intensification rules to avoid local minima and ensure global exploration.]
- [The final output should provide the tour for each robot starting and ending at its designated depot city, the total travel cost for each tour, and the overall combined cost for all tours.]
