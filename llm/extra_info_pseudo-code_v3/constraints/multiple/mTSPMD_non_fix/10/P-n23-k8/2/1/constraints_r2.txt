- [There are 23 cities with specified coordinates, including 7 depots and 16 non-depot cities.]
- [There are 8 robots, all starting from depot city 0.]
- [Travel cost between two cities is calculated as the Euclidean distance.]
- [Each robot starts from a designated depot (initially depot 0 for all) and doesn't need to return to a depot after completing its tour.]
- [The task is to ensure that each robot visits a set of cities so that collectively all cities are visited exactly once.]
- [The goal is to minimize the total combined travel cost of all robots.]
- [A feasible solution should use heuristics like Nearest Neighborhood Search (NNS) for initial solution generation.]
- [Tabu Search algorithm with specified neighborhood move operators (Relocate, Exchange, Tail-swap, Depot-exchange) and a tabu list should be used for finding the optimal or near-optimal solution.]
- [The search process involves multiple iterations, a tabu list to prevent cycling and a Pareto principle for evaluating solutions.]
- [Stopping criteria for the algorithm are either a specified number of total iterations or iterations since the last best solution was found.]
- [The output should list tours for each robot starting and ending at their designated depots, the total travel cost for each tour, and the overall total travel cost.]
