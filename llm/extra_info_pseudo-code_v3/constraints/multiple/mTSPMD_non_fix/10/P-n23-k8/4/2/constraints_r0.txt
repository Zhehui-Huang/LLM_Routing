- [Requirement 1] Each robot starts from depot city 0 and does not need to return to the depot after completing its tour.
- [Requirement 2] All cities, including depots, must be visited exactly once by the robots collectively.
- [Requirement 3] The goal is to determine the shortest individual tours for each robot while minimizing the total travel cost for all robots combined.
- [Requirement 4] Travel cost is calculated based on Euclidean distance between two cities.
- [Requirement 5] Output the tours for each robot as a list of city indices, starting and ending at assigned depots, and include individual and total travel costs.
