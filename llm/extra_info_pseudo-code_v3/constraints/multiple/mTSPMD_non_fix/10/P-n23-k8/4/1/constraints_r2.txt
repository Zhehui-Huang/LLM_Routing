- [There are 23 cities, including depots and regular cities, each with specific coordinates.]
- [8 robots are available, all starting from depot city 0.]
- [Each robot can travel between any two cities.]
- [Travel cost is determined by the Euclidean distance between cities.]
- [Each city must be visited exactly once by the robots.]
- [Robots do not need to return to their starting depot after completing their tours.]
- [The goal is to minimize the total travel cost for all robots combined.]
- [Output is required in a specific format showing the tour and total travel cost for each robot as well as the overall total travel cost.]
