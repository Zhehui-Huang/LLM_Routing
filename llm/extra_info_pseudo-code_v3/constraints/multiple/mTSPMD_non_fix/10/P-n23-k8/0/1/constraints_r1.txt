- [There are 23 cities indexed from 0 to 22 with specified coordinates.]
- [The number of robots is 8; all begin their tour from depot city 0.]
- [Travel cost is the Euclidean distance between two cities.]
- [Robots need to collectively visit all cities exactly once.]
- [Each robot starts from a designated depot but does not need to return to the depot after completing its tour.]
- [The robots can stop at any city as their endpoint.]
- [The goal is to determine the shortest tours for each robot while minimizing the total travel cost for all robots combined.]
- [Use Tabu Search algorithm with specified operators and phases including initialization, main loop, and diversification.]
- [The tours need to start and end at their assigned depot as per the output format requirements.]
- [The output must list the tours for each robot, the total travel cost for each tour, and the overall total travel cost.]
