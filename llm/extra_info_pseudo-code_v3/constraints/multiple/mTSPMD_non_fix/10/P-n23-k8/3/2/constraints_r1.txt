- [There are 23 cities with specified coordinates.]
- [Each city must be visited exactly once by any of the 8 robots.]
- [All robots start at depot city 0.]
- [Robots do not need to return to a depot after completing their tour.]
- [Travel cost is calculated as the Euclidean distance between two cities.]
- [The goal is to determine the shortest tours for each robot while minimizing the total travel cost for all robots combined.]
- [Initial solutions are generated using a nearest neighborhood search (NNS) heuristic.]
- [Tabu Search (TS) algorithm is used with specific neighborhood structures and move operators for local search.]
- [Neighborhood structures include relocate, exchange, tail-swap, and depot-exchange operators.]
- [A Tabu list keeps track of attributes of solutions to prevent cycling.]
- [The algorithm involves an intra exchanging phase to improve solutions.]
- [Stopping criteria of the search are based on specified number of iterations or lack of improvement after a set number of iterations.]
- [Output should include the tour for each robot starting and ending at its assigned depot, individual travel costs for each tour, and the overall travel cost.]
