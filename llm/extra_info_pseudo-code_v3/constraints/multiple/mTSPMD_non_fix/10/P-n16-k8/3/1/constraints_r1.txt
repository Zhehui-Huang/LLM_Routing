- [There are 16 cities, each with unique coordinates.]
- [Eight robots are available, and all start at depot city 0.]
- [Travel cost is determined by the Euclidean distance between two cities.]
- [Each city must be visited exactly once by the robots.]
- [Robots start from a designated depot and do not need to return to the depot after completing their tour.]
- [The goal is to minimize the total travel cost for all robots combined.]
- [Cities designated as depots are from city 0 to city 7, the rest are regular cities.]
- [Tours must be optimized for the lowest total travel distance.]
- [Output should specify tours for each robot starting and ending at its assigned depot.]
- [Output should include the total travel cost for each tour and the cumulative cost for all tours.]
