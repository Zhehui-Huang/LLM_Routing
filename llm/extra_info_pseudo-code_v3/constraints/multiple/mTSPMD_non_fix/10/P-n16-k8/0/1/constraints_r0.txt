- [There are 16 cities, including depots (cities 0-7) and regular cities (cities 8-15).]
- [Robots start the journey at depot city 0.]
- [All robots have traveling capabilities between any two cities.]
- [Travel cost is calculated using the Euclidean distance between cities.]
- [Each city must be visited exactly once by the robots combined, not individually.]
- [Robots do not need to return to their starting depot after completing their tour; they can stop at any city.]
- [The goal is to determine the shortest possible tours for each robot while minimizing the combined total travel cost.]
- [Use the Nearest Neighbor Search (NNS) for establishing the initial tour setup.]
- [Employ Tabu Search (TS) for optimizing the initial tours, utilizing neighborhood structures like relocate, exchange, tail-swap, and depot-exchange operators.]
- [Implement a tabu list to prevent cycling and facilitate exploration of the space.]
- [The search will terminate either after a set number of iterations or after the last best solution is found.]
- [Output should include a list of cities visited in order for each robot starting and ending at a depot, as well as the total cost for each tour and overall total travel cost.]
