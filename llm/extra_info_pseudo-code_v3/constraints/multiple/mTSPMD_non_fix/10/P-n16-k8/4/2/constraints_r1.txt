- [There are 16 cities with specified coordinates.]
- [There are 8 robots, all starting from depot city 0.]
- [Travel cost is calculated as the Euclidean distance between two cities.]
- [Each city needs to be visited exactly once by the robots collectively.]
- [Each robot starts from a designated depot and does not need to return to the depot after completing its tour.]
- [The robots can stop at any city as their endpoint.]
- [The goal is to determine the shortest tours for each robot while minimizing the total travel cost for all robots combined.]
- [The initial solution should use the Nearest Neighborhood Search (NNS) algorithm.]
- [Various neighborhood structures based on the 2-interchange mechanism should be used to generate neighbor solutions.]
- [Move operators include Relocate, Exchange, Tail-swap, and Depot-exchange.]
- [A tabu list is used to keep track of recently made moves or visited solutions.]
- [The search stops after a specified number of iterations or after a specified number of iterations without any improvement in the best solution.]
- [The solution involves an intra exchanging phase to improve the current solution by exchanging pairs of nodes within individual tours.]
- [The Tabu Search algorithm is guided by the Pareto principle for acceptance of neighbor solutions.]
- [Output the tours for each robot as a list of city indices starting and ending at its assigned depot.]
- [Output the total travel cost for each tour and the overall total travel cost.]
