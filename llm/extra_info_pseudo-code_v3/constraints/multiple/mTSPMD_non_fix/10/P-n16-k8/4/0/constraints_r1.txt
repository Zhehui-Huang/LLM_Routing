- [There are 16 cities with specified coordinates.]
- [There are 8 robots, all starting from the same depot city 0.]
- [Robots can travel between any two cities.]
- [Travel cost is calculated as the Euclidean distance between two cities.]
- [Each city must be visited exactly once by the robots collectively.]
- [Each robot starts its tour from a designated depot but does not need to return to the depot after completing its tour.]
- [The goal is to minimize the total travel cost for all robots combined while ensuring each city is visited exactly once.]
- [Output the tours for each robot as a list of city indices, starting and ending at the assigned depot.]
- [Output the total travel cost for each tour and the overall total travel travel cost.]
- [Use the Tabu Search algorithm with specific operators and phases as mentioned for optimization.]
