- [There are 22 cities with specified coordinates.]
- [There are four robots, all starting at depot city 0.]
- [Robots can travel between any two cities.]
- [Travel cost is the Euclidean distance between cities.]
- [Robots need to collectively visit all cities exactly once.]
- [Each robot starts from a designated depot but does not need to return to the depot after completing its tour.]
- [Each robot can stop at any city as their endpoint.]
- [The goal is to determine the shortest tours for each robot while minimizing the total travel cost for all robots combined.]
- [Use Tabu Search (TS) algorithm with specified heuristics and move operators for optimization.]
- [Output should include the tours for each robot as a list of city indices starting and ending at its assigned depot.]
- [Output should include the total travel cost for each robot and the overall total travel cost.]
