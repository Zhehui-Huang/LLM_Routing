- [There are 22 cities including 4 depot cities.]
- [Each city has a specific (x, y) coordinate.]
- [There are 4 robots, each starting from depot city 0.]
- [Travel cost between cities is calculated using the Euclidean distance.]
- [Robots need to collectively visit all cities exactly once.]
- [Each robot starts from a depot city but does not need to return to the depot after completing its tour.]
- [The goal is to minimize the total travel cost for all robots combined.]
- [Each city should be visited exactly once and tours should be optimized for the lowest total travel distance.]
- [The initial solution and neighborhood structures for the optimization use a Tabu Search (TS) algorithm which includes nearest neighborhood search, relocate, exchange, and tail-swap operations.]
- [The problem seeks to minimize the resultant tours travel costs for each robot, along with the overall travel cost.]
