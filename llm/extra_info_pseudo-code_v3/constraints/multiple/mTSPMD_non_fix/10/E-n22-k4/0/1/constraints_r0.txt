- [All robots start from depot city 0.]
- [Each robot starts from a designated depot but does not need to return to the depot after completing its tour.]
- [The robots need to collectively visit all cities exactly once.]
- [Ensure that each city is visited exactly once and that the tours are optimized for the lowest total travel distance or cost.]
- [Robots can travel between any two cities.]
- [Travel cost is calculated as the Euclidean distance between two cities.]
- [Output the tours for each robot as a list of city indices, where each tour should start and end at its assigned depot.]
- [Output the total travel cost for each tour and the overall total travel cost.]
