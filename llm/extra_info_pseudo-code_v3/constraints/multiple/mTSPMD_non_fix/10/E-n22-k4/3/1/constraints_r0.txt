- [There are 22 cities, including four depot cities, with specific coordinates provided.]
- [Four robots are available; each starts from the same designated depot city 0.]
- [Travel costs between cities are computed using the Euclidean distance.]
- [Each robot should visit all cities exactly once, collectively among them.]
- [The robots start from a depot and do not need to return to the depot after completing their tour; they can stop at any city.]
- [The objective is to minimize the total combined travel cost for all robots.]
- [The solution needs to comply with the Tabu Search algorithm with specific neighborhood structures and move operators including relocate, exchange, tail-swap, and depot-exchange.]
- [The solution must be initialized using a Nearest Neighborhood Search heuristic.]
- [The tabu list contains fitness function attributes of solutions and controls the acceptance of new solutions based on whether they are non-dominated (Pareto principle).]
- [The tabu list should be managed by incrementing the iteration count and resetting it when an improvement is found, or changing the solution after no improvements for a set of iterations (consecutive iterations condition).]
- [A stopping criterion is defined by a maximum number of iterations or an empty tabu list.]
- [An intra exchanging phase should be used for further optimization within the tours.]
- [Various neighborhood move operators are implemented, each being selected randomly during the algorithm's main loop to modify the current solution.]
- [Output the tours for each robot as a list of city indices and provide the travel cost for each tour, as well as the overall total travel cost.]
