- [There are 22 cities including 4 depots.]
- [All robots start at depot city 0 and can stop at any city as their endpoint.]
- [The goal is for the robots to collectively visit all cities exactly once, where each city can only be visited by one robot.]
- [Each city is visited exactly once, and the tours should be optimized for the lowest total combined travel distance or cost for all robots.]
- [The travel cost is calculated as the Euclidean distance between two cities.]
- [Use a Tabu Search (TS) algorithm to solve the problem, incorporating neighbor moves, initialization with NNS, and acceptance based on non-dominance.]
- [Output should include the tours for each robot starting and ending at its designated depot and the total and overall travel costs.]
