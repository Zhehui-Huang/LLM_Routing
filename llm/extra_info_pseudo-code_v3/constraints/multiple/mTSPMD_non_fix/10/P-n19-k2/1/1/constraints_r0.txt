- [Requirement 1: All robots must start their tour from the designated depot city and can stop at any city as their endpoint.]
- [Requirement 2: All tours must visit each city exactly once and collectively cover all cities.]
- [Requirement 3: The objective is to minimize the total travel cost for all robots combined while ensuring each city is visited exactly once.]
- [Requirement 4: The distance between two cities is calculated using the Euclidean formula.]
- [Requirement 5: The solution must incorporate approaches such as Tabu Search with a specific set of operations including Relocate, Exchange, Tail-swap, and Depot-exchange.]
- [Requirement 6: The tours for each robot should be output as a list of city indices, clearly indicating the start and end at the assigned depot for each robot.]
- [Requirement 7: Output should also include the total travel cost for each robotâ€™s tour and the overall total travel cost.]
- [Requirement 8: The search terminates either after a specified number of total iterations or consecutive iterations without improvement.]
- [Requirement 9: The Tabu list is maintained to track recently made moves or visited solutions to prevent cycling and foster exploration.]
