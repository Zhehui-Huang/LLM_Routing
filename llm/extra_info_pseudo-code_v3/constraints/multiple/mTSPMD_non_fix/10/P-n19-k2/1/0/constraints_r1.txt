- [There are 19 cities including two depot cities.]
- [City coordinates are given for each of the 19 cities.]
- [There are 2 robots available for completing the tours.]
- [All robots start at depot city 0.]
- [Robots can travel between any two cities.]
- [Travel cost is calculated using the Euclidean distance between two cities.]
- [Each city must be visited exactly once by the robots collectively.]
- [Each robot's tour starts from a designated depot and does not necessarily need to return to the depot.]
- [The humanoid robots can end their tour at any city.]
- [The objective is to minimize the total travel cost for all robots combined while ensuring each city is visited exactly once.]
- [Output should include individual tours for each robot starting and ending at its assigned depot, individual travel costs for each tour, and the overall total travel layer cost.]
