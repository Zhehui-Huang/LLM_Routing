- [Requirement 1: Environment includes 19 cities with specific coordinates for each, including two depot cities at indices 0 and 1.]
- [Requirement 2: There are 2 robots, both starting from depot city 0. Each robot must start and finish at a designated depot, but can end at any other city.]
- [Requirement 3: Travel cost is calculated based on the Euclidean distance between coordinates of the cities.]
- [Requirement 4: Each robot must visit all cities exactly once collectively between them, ensuring an optimal solution with the lowest total distance cost.]
- [Requirement 5: The task requires using a tabu search algorithm with a specific initial solution generation using nearest neighborhood search (NNS).]
- [Requirement 6: Moves/operators like Relocate, Exchange, Tail-swap, and Depot-exchange must be implemented to explore possible solutions.]
- [Requirement 7: Tabu list is managed to keep track of visited solutions, preventing cycles and helping in exploring new solutions.]
- [Requirement 8: The tabu search algorithm should have a stopping criterion based on a maximum number of iterations or non-improvement in the solution.]
- [Requirement 9: Solution output format must report the tour for each robot, travel costs for each tour, and the overall total travel cost.]
