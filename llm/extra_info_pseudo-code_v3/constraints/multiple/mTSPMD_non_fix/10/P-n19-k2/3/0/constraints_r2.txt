- [Requirement 1] There are 19 cities, with specific coordinates provided for each, including two depot cities designated for the start of the robot tours.
- [Requirement 2] Two robots are available, both initially starting from depot city 0, required to visit all cities exactly once collectively.
- [Requirement 3] Each robot can start from a specific depot city and end at any city; it does not need to return to the initial depot after completing its tour.
- [Requirement 4] The goal is to determine the shortest possible tours for each robot that minimize the total travel cost for all robots combined.
- [Requirement 5] Travel costs are determined using the Euclidean distance formula between two city coordinates.
- [Requirement 6] A heuristic algorithm (Nearest Neighborhood Search, NNS) is used to generate the initial solution for the tours.
- [Requirement 7] The local search is enhanced with move operators such as relocate, exchange, tail-swap, and depot-exchange.
- [Requirement 8] A tabu list is maintained to avoid cycles in the search by keeping track of recently made moves or visited solutions.
- [Requirement 9] The tabu search algorithm continues until a specified number of iterations have elapsed or until no improvements are seen in a number of consecutive iterations.
- [Requirement 10] The solution should output each robot's tour as a list of city indices starting and ending at its assigned depot.
- [Requirement 11] The solution should also include the total travel cost for each robotâ€™s tour and the combined total travel cost for all robots.
