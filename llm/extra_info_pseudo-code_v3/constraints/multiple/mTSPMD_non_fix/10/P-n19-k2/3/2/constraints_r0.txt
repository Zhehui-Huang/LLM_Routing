- [There are 19 cities with specified coordinates.]
- [There are 2 robots, starting at depot city 0.]
- [Robots can travel between any two cities.]
- [Travel cost is the Euclidean distance between two cities.]
- [Each robot must visit all cities exactly once collectively.]
- [Each robot starts from a designated depot.]
- [Robots do not need to return to the depot after completing their tour.]
- [End points of the tours can be any city.]
- [The goal is to minimize the total travel cost while ensuring each city is visited exactly once.]
- [The tours are divided between the robots to minimize total travel distance.]
- [Output should specify the tour and the individual and total travel costs for each robot.]
- [Initial solution generation uses a nearest neighborhood search based heuristic.]
- [Four move operators are defined for generating new solutions: relocate, exchange, tail-swap, and depot-exchange.]
- [A tabu list is maintained to avoid cycles and promote exploration.]
- [The search terminates based on a specified number of iterations or stall conditions.]
- [There are diversification mechanisms in the algorithm through stochastic neighborhood selection and varying tabu lengths.]
