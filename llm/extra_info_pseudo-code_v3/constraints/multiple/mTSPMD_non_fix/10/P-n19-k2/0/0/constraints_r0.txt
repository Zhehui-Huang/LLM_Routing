- [Each robot must visit all cities exactly once, collectively covering all 19 cities.]
- [Each tour should start from the designated depot city and does not need to return to the depot after completing the tour.]
- [The overall goal is to minimize the total combined travel cost of all tours.]
- [Travel cost between cities is calculated based on the Euclidean distance.]
- [Tabu Search (TS) with various neighborhood structures and operators should be used to optimize the tours.]
- [A Pareto principle should be applied for the neighbor solution acceptance to ensure solutions are non-dominated.]
- [The optimization process will use an initial solution generated by a Nearest Neighborhood Search (NNS) heuristic.]
- [Four specific move operators are used: Relocate, Exchange, Tail-swap, and Depot-exchange.]
- [A tabu list will be maintained to prevent cycling and to promote exploration of new areas.]
- [The search process terminates either after a set number of total iterations or after a set number of iterations that have passed without any improvement to the best solution.]
- [Each robotâ€™s tour should be outputted as a list of city indices, starting and ending at its assigned depot.]
- [Total travel cost for each tour and the combined total cost must be calculated and outputted.]
