- [The environment includes a depot city (city 0) and 14 other cities, making a total of 15 cities.]
- [Cities are grouped into 6 groups, and the robot must visit one city from each group.]
- [The robot starts and ends its tour at the depot city (city 0).]
- [The travel cost is calculated based on the Euclidean distance between cities.]
- [The robot's task is to determine the shortest possible tour that includes one city from each group and returns to the depot.]
- [The output should be the sequential list of city indices traveled by the robot, beginning and ending with city 0.]
- [The total travel cost of the tour should also be reported alongside the city indices.]
