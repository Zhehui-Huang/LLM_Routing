- [There are 15 cities, including the depot city 0.]
- [The depot city 0 coordinates are (16, 90).]
- [City coordinates for each of the 15 cities are specified.]
- [There are 6 city groups, each specifying a subset of cities.]
- [There is one robot that starts and ends its journey at the depot city 0.]
- [The robot can travel between any two cities.]
- [The travel cost is calculated using the Euclidean distance between two cities.]
- [The robot needs to visit exactly one city from each group of cities.]
- [The robotâ€™s tour must find the shortest path satisfying the condition of visiting one city from each group and starting and ending at the depot city.]
- [Output the tour as a list of city indices starting and ending at depot city 0.]
- [Output the total travel cost of the tour.]
