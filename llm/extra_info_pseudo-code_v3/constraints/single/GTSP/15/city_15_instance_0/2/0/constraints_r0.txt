- [There are 15 cities, designated numerically from 0 (depot city) to 14.]
- [The robot must start and end its tour at the depot city (City 0).]
- [The robot must visit exactly one city from each of the three groups during its tour.]
- [Travel costs between cities are calculated using the Euclidean distance.]
- [The challenge is to find the shortest tour following the above constraints.]
- [The result should include both the tour as a list of city indices and the total travel cost of the tour.]
