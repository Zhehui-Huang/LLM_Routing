- [There are 15 cities, each identified with fixed coordinates.]
- [The robot must start and end its tour at the depot city, which is city 0.]
- [The robot must visit exactly one city from each of the 5 city groups.]
- [Travel costs between cities are calculated using the Euclidean distance.]
- [The objective is to find the shortest possible tour that meets the above constraints.]
- [Output should include both the tour and the total travel cost.]
