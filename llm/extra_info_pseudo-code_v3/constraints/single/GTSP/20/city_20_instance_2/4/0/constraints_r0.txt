- [The robot must start and end its tour at the depot city 0.]
- [The robot must visit exactly one city from each group of cities (5 groups total).]
- [Travel costs between cities are calculated based on the Euclidean distance.]
- [The solution should minimize the total travel distance for the complete tour.]
