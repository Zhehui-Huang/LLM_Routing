- [The environment consists of 20 cities with specific coordinates.]
- [The depot, city 0, has coordinates (14, 77).]
- [There are 4 city groups, and each group contains specific city indices.]
- [There is one robot for this task.]
- [The robot must start and end its journey at the depot city 0.]
- [The robot can travel between any two cities.]
- [Travel cost is calculated based on the Euclidean distance between two cities.]
- [The robot must visit exactly one city from each group.]
- [The target is to find the shortest tour that satisfies all problem constraints.]
- [Output should provide the tour as a list of city indices]
- [Output should also provide the total travel cost of the tour.]
