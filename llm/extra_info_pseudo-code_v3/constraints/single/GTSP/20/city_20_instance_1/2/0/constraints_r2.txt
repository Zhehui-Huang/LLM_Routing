- [The robot needs to start and end the tour at the depot city 0.]
- [Exactly one city from each of the four city groups must be visited by the robot.]
- [The travel cost is calculated as the Euclidean distance between the cities.]
- [The solution should find the shortest possible tour that satisfies the above conditions.]
- [Output the tour as a list of city indices starting and ending at the depot city 0.]
- [Output the total travel cost of the tour.]
