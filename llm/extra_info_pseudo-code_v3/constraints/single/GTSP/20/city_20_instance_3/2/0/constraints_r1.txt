- [There are 20 cities, each identified by city numbers from 0 to 19.]
- [The depot city is city 0 with coordinates (30, 56).]
- [City groups are divided as follows: Group 0 [4, 10, 13, 17], Group 1 [6, 7, 14], Group 2 [9, 12, 16], Group 3 [2, 5, 15], Group 4 [1, 3, 19], Group 5 [8, 11, 18].]
- [One robot starts at the depot city 0 and must end its tour at the depot city as well.]
- [The robot can travel between any two cities.]
- [Travel cost is calculated as the Euclidean distance between two cities.]
- [The robot needs to visit exactly one city from each group of cities, ensuring the formation of a tour starting and ending at the depot.]
- [The objective is to find the shortest tour possible given the specified conditions.]
- [Output should list the tour as a sequence of city indices starting and ending with the depot city 0.]
- [Output should also include the total travel cost of the tour.]
