- [The robot must start and end its journey at the depot city, which is city 0.]
- [The robot needs to visit exactly one city from each of the six city groups.]
- [Travel cost between any two cities is calculated using the Euclidean distance formula.]
- [The output should include the tour as a list of city indices starting and ending at the depot city.]
- [The output should also include the total travel cost of the tour.]
