- [There are 10 cities, each identified with a unique index from 0 to 9 and specific coordinates.]
- [City groups are specified with Group 0 including cities 1, 2, 6, Group 1 including cities 3, 7, 8, and Group 2 including cities 4, 5, 9.]
- [A robot starts its route at the depot city (city 0), makes a round trip, and must return to the depot city by the end.]
- [The robot must visit exactly one city from each group during its tour.]
- [Travel cost between any two cities is calculated based using the Euclidean distance formula.]
- [The objective is to find the shortest possible tour that meets the above travel requirements.]
- [The output should be formatted as two specific entities: a list reflecting the tour starting and ending at the depot city, and the total travel cost.]
