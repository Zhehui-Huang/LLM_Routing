- [The robot must visit exactly one city from each group of cities, starting and ending at the depot city (0).]
- [The travel cost between any two cities is calculated using the Euclidean distance formula.]
- [The robot needs to find the shortest tour possible.]
- [The output should be a tour starting and ending at the depot city represented as a list of city indices.]
- [The total travel cost of the tour should also be provided in the output.]
