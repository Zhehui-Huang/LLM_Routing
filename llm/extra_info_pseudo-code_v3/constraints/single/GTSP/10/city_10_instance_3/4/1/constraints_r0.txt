- [The robot must visit exactly one city from each group of cities.]
- [The robot needs to start and end at the depot city (City 0).]
- [The travel cost between any two cities is determined by computing the Euclidean distance.]
- [The solution should find the shortest tour for the robot, considering all specified groups and distances.]
- [The required output is a list of city indices representing the tour, and the total travel cost of this tour.]
