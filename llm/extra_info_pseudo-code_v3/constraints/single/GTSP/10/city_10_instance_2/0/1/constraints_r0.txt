- [There are 10 cities, indexed from 0 to 9 with specified locations.]
- [There is one depot city indexed as 0.]
- [Cities are grouped into five distinct groups, and each group contains specific cities.]
- [There is one robot that starts and ends its journey at the depot city 0.]
- [The robot must visit exactly one city from each group.]
- [Travel cost between cities is calculated using the Euclidean distance.]
- [The goal is to find the shortest possible tour that satisfies the above conditions.]
- [The output should be a list of city indices showing the tour starting and ending at city 0, and the total travel cost of that tour.]
