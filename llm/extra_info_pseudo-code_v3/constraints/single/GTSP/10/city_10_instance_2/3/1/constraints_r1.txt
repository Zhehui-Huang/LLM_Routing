- [There are 10 cities including the depot city, which is city 0.]
- [The coordinates of the depot and the other cities are provided.]
- [There is one robot starting at the depot city 0.]
- [The robot must visit exactly one city from each of the 5 groups of cities.]
- [The travel cost is calculated as the Euclidean distance between any two cities.]
- [The robot needs to find a tour starting and ending at the depot city 0.]
- [The robot's tour should minimize the total travel cost.]
- [Output should be the tour as a list of city indices starting and ending at city 0 and the total travel cost.]
