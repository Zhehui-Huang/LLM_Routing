- [There are 10 cities including a depot city, numbered from 0 (depot) to 9.]
- [The depot city 0 is located at coordinates (79, 15).]
- [Cities are located at specified coordinates: City 1 at (79, 55), City 2 at (4, 80), City 3 at (65, 26), City 4 at (92, 9), City 5 at (83, 61), City 6 at (22, 21), City 7 at (97, 70), City 8 at (20, 99), City 9 at (66, 62).]
- [Cities are grouped into 7 groups: Group 0 includes [1, 4], Group 1 includes [2, 6], Group 2 includes [7], Group 3 includes [5], Group 4 includes [9], Group 5 includes [8], Group 6 includes [3].]
- [The robot must visit exactly one city from each group, forming a tour that starts and ends at the depot city 0.]
- [Travel cost between any two cities is calculated as the Euclidean distance between them.]
