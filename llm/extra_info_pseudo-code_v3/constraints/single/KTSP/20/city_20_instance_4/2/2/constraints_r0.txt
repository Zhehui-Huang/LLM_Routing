- [The environment consists of 20 distinct cities.]
- [Depot city is labeled as 0: (26, 60).]
- [Each city has unique coordinates representing its position.]
- [There is one robot that starts and ends its tour at depot city 0.]
- [The robot is required to visit exactly 16 cities from the given set, including the depot city.]
- [Travel cost between any two cities is calculated using the Euclidean distance.]
- [The objective is to find the shortest possible tour that visits exactly 16 cities.]
- [The output should include the tour as a list of city indices starting and ending at city 0.]
- [The output should also include the total travel cost of the tour.]
