- [The problem involves a total of 20 cities, each represented as a unique place with specified coordinates.]
- [The depot city is City 0, located at coordinates (26, 60).]
- [The robot starts its tour at the depot city (City 0) and must also end the tour at the depot city.]
- [The travel cost between any two cities is computed using the Euclidean distance formula.]
- [The robot is required to visit exactly 16 different cities out of the available set, including the depot city.]
- [The goal is to determine the shortest possible route that visits precisely 16 cities and returns to the depot, minimizing the total travel distance.]
- [The output of the task should be the tour as a list of city indices beginning and ending with the depot city (0) and the total cost of this tour.] 
- [The solution approach provided to tackle this optimization is the General Variable Neighborhood Search (GVNS).]
- [Use specific subroutines like GenerateInitialSolution, Shake, and Variable Neighborhood Descent (VND) as part of the GVNS algorithm for solving the task.]
