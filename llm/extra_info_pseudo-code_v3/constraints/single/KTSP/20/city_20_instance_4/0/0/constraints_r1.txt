- [The task involves 20 specific cities with known coordinates, including a depot city where the robot starts and ends its tour.]
- [The robot must visit exactly 16 out of the 20 cities, starting and ending at the depot city.]
- [Travel costs between cities are calculated based on the Euclidean distance.]
- [The goal is to find the shortest possible tour that meets the city visit requirements.]
- [The solution should be executed utilizing the General Variable Neighborhood Search (GVNS) algorithm specifically designed for the k-TSP variant.]
- [The output must represent the tour as a list of city indices beginning and ending with the depot city, and include the total travel cost.]
- [Initial solutions are generated randomly, maintaining the depot city as the starting point.]
- [The GVNS algorithm iterates through different neighborhood structures (N1 and N2) to escape local optima and improve the solution.]
- [Termination of the algorithm is subject to a specified criterion such as a maximum number of iterations or a time limit.]
