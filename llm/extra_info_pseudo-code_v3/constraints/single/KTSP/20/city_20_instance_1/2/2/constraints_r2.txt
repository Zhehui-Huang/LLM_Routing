- [The environment consists of 20 cities with specific coordinates.]
- [There is one robot starting at the depot city (index 0).]
- [The robot must visit exactly 7 cities, including the depot city.]
- [The starting and ending point of the robot's tour must be the depot city.]
- [Travel cost between any two cities is calculated as the Euclidean distance.]
- [The goal is to find the shortest possible tour that visits these 7 cities.]
- [Output should be in the format: Tour as a list of city indices starting and ending at city 0, and the total travel cost of the tour.]
