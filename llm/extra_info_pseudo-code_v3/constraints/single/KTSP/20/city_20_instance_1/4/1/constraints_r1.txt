- [Requirement 1] The robot must start and end its route at the depot city, which is city 0.
- [Requirement 2] The tour must include exactly 7 cities, out of the 20 available cities.
- [Requirement 3] The robot's travel cost between two cities is calculated as the Euclidean distance between those cities.
- [Requirement 4] The aim is to minimize the total travel cost of the tour.
- [Requirement 5] Output must be in the format: Tour: [list of city indices] and Total travel cost: [numerical value].
- [Requirement 6] Employ a GVNS algorithm to solve this problem, considering the specific components and steps outlined in the provided pseudocode.
