- [Requirement 1] The solution must start and end at the depot city 0.
- [Requirement 2] The robot needs to visit exactly 10 cities, including the depot city, to complete the tour.
- [Requirement 3] The tour's total length (travel cost) should be calculated based on the Euclidean distance between cities.
- [Requirement 4] The goal is to find the shortest possible tour under the given constraints.
- [Requirement 5] Output the tour as a list of city indices, beginning and ending at the depot.
- [Requirement 6] Output the total travel cost of the tour.
- [Requirement 7] Utilize the General Variable Neighborhood Search (GVNS) algorithm to solve this variant of the k-TSP.
