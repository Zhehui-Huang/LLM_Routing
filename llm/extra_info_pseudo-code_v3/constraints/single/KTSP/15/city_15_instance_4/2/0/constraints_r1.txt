- [The robot must start and end its journey at the depot city, which is city 0.]
- [The robot must visit exactly 12 out of the 15 provided cities.]
- [The goal is to find the shortest possible tour that minimizes the travel cost calculated as the Euclidean distance between cities.]
- [The output should be the tour as a list of city indices starting and ending at depot city 0, and the total travel cost of the tour.]
