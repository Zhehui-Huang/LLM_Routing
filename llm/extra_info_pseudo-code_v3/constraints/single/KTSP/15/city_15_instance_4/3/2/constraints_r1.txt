- [The environment consists of 15 cities, including a depot at city 0.]
- [The depot city is at coordinates (35, 40).]
- [Each other city is identified with specific coordinates.]
- [There is one robot for the task.]
- [The robot starts and ends its tour at the depot city 0.]
- [The robot can travel between any two cities.]
- [Travel cost is calculated as the Euclidean distance between two cities.]
- [The task requires visiting exactly 12 cities out of the available set, including the depot city.]
- [The goal is to find the shortest possible tour that visits these 12 cities.]
- [Tour should be formatted as a list of city indices starting and ending at depot city 0.]
- [Output should include the total travel cost of the tour.]
