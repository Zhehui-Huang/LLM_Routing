- [The robot starts at depot city 0 and must also end the tour there.]
- [The robot needs to visit exactly 12 cities from a list of 15 available cities, including the depot city.]
- [The task is to find the shortest tour that visits and returns while complying with the above constraints.]
- [Travel costs between cities are calculated using Euclidean distance.]
- [The solution must be output as a list of city indices, representing the tour, starting and ending at city 0, and including the total travel cost of this tour.]
