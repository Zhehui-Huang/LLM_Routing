- [Requirement 1] The robot must start and end its tour at the depot city, which is city 0.
- [Requirement 2] The tour must include exactly 12 cities from the given set of 15 cities.
- [Requirement 3] The travel cost must be calculated using the Euclidean distance between cities.
- [Requirement 4] The goal is to find the shortest possible tour that abides by the earlier mentioned constraints.
- [Requirement 5] The output should list the tour as a sequence of city indices starting and ending at city 0, and should also include the total travel cost.
- [Requirement 6] The solution to the problem shall utilize the General Variable Neighborhood Search (GVNS) algorithm as described, including the subroutines for initial solution generation, shaking for diversification, and variable neighborhood descent for iterative improvement.
