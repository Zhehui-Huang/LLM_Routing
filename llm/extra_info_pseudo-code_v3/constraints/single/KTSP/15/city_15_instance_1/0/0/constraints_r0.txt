- [The environment consists of 15 cities, each with a specific coordinate.]
- [The robot starts at the depot city 0 and must also end the tour there.]
- [The robot can travel directly between any two cities.]
- [Travel costs are calculated using the Euclidean distance between cities.]
- [The robot needs to visit exactly 6 cities during its journey, including the depot city.]
- [The objective is to find the shortest possible route that visits exactly 6 cities and returns to the start.]
- [The solution should utilize the General Variable Neighborhood Search (GVNS) algorithm.]
- [Output should list the tour as a sequence of city indices starting and ending at the depot city.]
- [Output should also include the total travel cost of the tour.]
