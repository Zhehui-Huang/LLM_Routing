- [City coordinates are provided for all cities.]
- [There is one robot that starts and ends at the depot city.]
- [The robot must visit exactly 10 cities out of the 15, including the depot.]
- [Travel cost is calculated as the Euclidean distance between two cities.]
- [The goal is to find the shortest possible tour that visits exactly 10 cities.]
- [The solution must start and end at the depot city.]
- [Output the tour as a list of city indices.]
- [Output the total travel cost of the tour.]
