- [The robot must start and end its tour at the depot city, which is city 0.]
- [The robot needs to visit exactly 8 cities, including the depot city.]
- [The objective of the task is to find the shortest possible tour that visits these cities.]
- [Travel cost between cities is calculated as the Euclidean distance.]
- [The tour should be represented as a list of city indices starting and ending at the depot city.]
- [The output should include both the list containing the tour's path and the total travel cost of that tour.]
