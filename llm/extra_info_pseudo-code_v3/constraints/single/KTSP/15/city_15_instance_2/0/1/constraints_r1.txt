- [There are 15 cities, each with specific coordinates.]
- [The robot must start and end its journey at the depot city (City 0).]
- [The robot is required to visit exactly 8 cities, including the depot city.]
- [Travel cost is calculated as the Euclidean distance between any two cities.]
- [The objective is to minimize the total travel cost of the tour.]
- [The solution must be based on the General Variable Neighborhood Search (GVNS) algorithm as described.]
- [The output should be the tour as a list of city indices and the total travel cost.]
- [The tour in the output should include the depot city both as the start and the end.]
- [The GVNS should use defined neighborhood structures N1 (Subset Selection) and N2 (Permutation) during its execution.]
