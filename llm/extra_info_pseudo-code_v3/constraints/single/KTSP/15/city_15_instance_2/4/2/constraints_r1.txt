- [The robot must visit exactly 8 cities including the depot city.]
- [The starting and ending point of the tour must be the depot city (city 0).]
- [Travel cost is calculated as the Euclidean distance between any two cities.]
- [The goal is to minimize the total travel cost of the tour.]
- [The solution must be obtained using the GVNS algorithm specifically designed for this k-TSP variant.]
- [Output format requires the tour to be listed as city indices starting and ending at the depot city.]
- [Output format also requires presenting the total travel cost of the tour.]
