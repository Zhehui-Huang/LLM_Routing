- [Requirement 1] The robot must start and end its tour at the depot city, which is city 0.
- [Requirement 2] The tour must include exactly 4 cities, including the depot city.
- [Requirement 3] The total travel cost of the tour, which is the sum of the Euclidean distances between consecutive cities in the tour, must be minimized.
- [Requirement 4] The solution must be outputted as a list of city indices, beginning and ending with the depot city 0.
- [Requirement 5] The total travel cost of the tour must also be outputted.
- [Requirement 6] The algorithm to solve the problem must implement the General Variable Neighborhood Search (GVNS) method as described.
