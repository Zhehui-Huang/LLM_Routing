- [The robot must start and end its tour at the depot city, which is city 0.]
- [The tour must include exactly 4 cities, including the depot city.]
- [The travel cost between cities is calculated using the Euclidean distance.]
- [The aim is to find the shortest possible tour that visits exactly 4 cities.]
- [The output of the solution must include a list of city indices representing the tour, starting and ending at the depot city, and the total travel cost of the tour.]
