- [There are 10 cities, including the depot city 0.]
- [The depot city 0 has coordinates (50, 42).]
- [Each subsequent city from 1 to 9 has specific coordinates given.]
- [There is one robot which starts at depot city 0.]
- [The robot can travel between any two cities.]
- [Travel cost is calculated using the Euclidean distance between two cities.]
- [The robot needs to visit exactly 4 cities, including the depot city.]
- [The journey must start and end at the depot city 0.]
- [The objective is to find the shortest possible tour that visits exactly 4 cities.]
- [The tour should be output as a list of city indices, starting and ending at city 0.]
- [Output should also include the total travel cost of the tour.]
