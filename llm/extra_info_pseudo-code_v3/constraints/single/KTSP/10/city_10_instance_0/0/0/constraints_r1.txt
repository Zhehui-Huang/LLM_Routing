- [The environment consists of 10 cities, including a depot city labelled as 0.]
- [Each city is identified by an index and has a specific coordinate.]
- [There is one robot available for the task.]
- [The robot must start and end its tour at the depot city (City 0).]
- [The robot is required to visit exactly 4 cities during its tour.]
- [The robot can travel between any two cities.]
- [Travel cost between cities is calculated using the Euclidean distance.]
- [The goal is to find the shortest possible tour that includes exactly 4 cities.]
- [Output the tour as a list of city indices starting and ending with the depot city 0.]
- [Output the total travel cost of the tour.]
