- [Requirement 1] The robot must start and end at the depot city, which is city 0.
- [Requirement 2] The robot has to visit exactly 4 cities, including the depot city.
- [Requirement 3] The travel cost is calculated as the Euclidean distance between the cities.
- [Requirement 4] The goal is to find the shortest possible tour that visits the required cities.
- [Requirement 5] Output the result as a list of city indices followed by the total travel cost.
- [Requirement 6] Use the General Variable Neighborhood Search (GVANTLR) algorithm as provided to solve the problem.
- [Requirement 7] The algorithm should explore different neighborhood structures to find a near-optimal solution.
