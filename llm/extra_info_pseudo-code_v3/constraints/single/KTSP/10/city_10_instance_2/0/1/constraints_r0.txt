- [The robot must start and end the tour at the depot city, which is city 0.]
- [The robot needs to visit exactly 6 cities out of the 10 available, including the depot city.]
- [The objective is to find the shortest possible tour that visits these 6 cities.]
- [The travel cost between any two cities is calculated using the Euclidean distance.]
- [The output should include the tour as a list of city indices and the total travel cost of the tour.]
- [The tour list should start and end at city 0.]
- [The travel cost should be calculated for the entire path, starting and ending at the depot city.]
