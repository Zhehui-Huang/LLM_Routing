- [The environment consists of 10 cities with specific coordinates.]
- [There is one robot that starts and ends its journey at the depot city, which is city 0.]
- [The robot is required to travel between cities, and the travel cost is the Euclidean distance between these cities.]
- [The robot must visit exactly 6 cities, including the depot city.]
- [The objective is to determine the shortest possible tour that adheres to these travel constraints.]
- [The solution should output both the tour as a list of city indices beginning and ending with the depot city, and the total travel cost of this tour.]
