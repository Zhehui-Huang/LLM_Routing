- [The environment consists of 10 specific cities with defined coordinates.]
- [There is one robot that operates as the traveling entity.]
- [The robot starts at the depot city which is numbered as city 0.]
- [The robot must visit exactly 7 out of the 10 cities, including the depot city.]
- [The journey must start and end at the depot city (city 0).]
- [Travel costs between cities are calculated using the Euclidean distance.]
- [The objective is to find the shortest possible route that meets these conditions.]
- [The solution must be represented as a tour in the form of a list of city indices, starting and ending at depot city 0.]
- [The total travel cost of the tour must be outputted alongside the tour list.]
- [The solution should use a modified version of the General Variable Neighborhood Search (GVN) algorithm tailored for this k-TSP variant, involving specific neighborhood structures and local optimization methods.]
