- [The robot must start and end its journey at the depot city (city 0).]
- [The robot must visit exactly 5 cities, including the depot city.]
- [Travel costs are computed based on the Euclidean distance between two cities.]
- [The tour and the corresponding total travel cost should be output: the tour as a list of city indices and the travel cost as a numerical value.]
- [The solution should identify the shortest possible tour meeting the above conditions.]
