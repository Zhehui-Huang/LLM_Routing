- [The task is to solve a variant of the k-Travelling Salesman Problem (k-TSP) with k equal to 5 cities.]
- [The robot starts at depot city 0 and must return there after visiting a total of 5 cities.]
- [Travel cost between cities is calculated using the Euclidean distance.]
- [The challenge is to find a tour that results in the shortest possible travel distance.]
- [A single robot is used which can travel between any two cities.]
- [The output must be formatted to include the tour as a list of city indices starting and ending at depot city 0, and the total travel cost of the tour.]
