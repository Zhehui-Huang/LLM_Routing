- [There are 15 cities including the depot.]
- [Depot city 0 starts at coordinates (35, 40).]
- [Positions for cities 1 to 14 are specified with specific coordinates.]
- [There is one robot starting at depot city 0.]
- [The robot must visit all cities exactly once, except the depot city, and return to the depot city.]
- [Travel cost is calculated as the Euclidean distance between two cities.]
- [Use Christofides algorithm to find an approximate shortest tour for the robot.]
- [Output should include the tour as a list of city indices starting and ending at city 0, and the total travel cost of the tour.]
