- [There are 15 cities including the depot city.]
- [Depot city 0: (54, 87).]
- [Cities have specified coordinates ranging from (6, 99) to (93, 44).]
- [There is one robot that starts at depot city 0.]
- [The robot must visit all cities exactly once, except for the depot city, and then return to the depot city.]
- [Travel cost is calculated as the Euclidean distance between two cities.]
- [The solution should employ Christofides algorithm which includes constructing a minimum spanning tree, finding a minimum-weight perfect matching on vertices of odd degree, forming a multigraph, finding an Eulerian circuit, and converting this into a Hamiltonian circuit.]
- [The output must specify the tour starting and ending at depot city 0 and include the total travel cost of the tour.]
