- [The robot must start and end its journey at the depot city, which is city 0.]
- [The robot must visit each city exactly once, except the depot city.]
- [The travel cost between two cities is determined by the Euclidean distance between them.]
- [The goal is to find the shortest possible tour that fulfills the above requirements.]
- [The output should be in the format of a list of city indices starting and ending at city 0, followed by the total travel cost.]
