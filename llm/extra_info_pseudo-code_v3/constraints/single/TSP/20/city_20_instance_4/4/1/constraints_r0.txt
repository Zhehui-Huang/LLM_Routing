- [There are 20 cities including the depot city.]
- [The depot city is city 0 with coordinates (26, 60).]
- [The robot starts and ends its tour at the depot city 0.]
- [The robot needs to visit all other cities exactly once.]
- [Travel cost is calculated as the Euclidean distance between cities.]
- [Christofides algorithm should be used to find an approximate solution to the TSP.]
- [Output should be a list of city indices starting and ending at depot city 0.]
- [Output should also include the total travel cost of the tour.]
