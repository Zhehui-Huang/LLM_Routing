- [The robot must start and end the tour at the depot city, which is city 0.]
- [The robot must visit each city exactly once, except the depot city.]
- [The travel cost is calculated as the Euclidean distance between any two cities.]
- [The solution must follow the steps outlined in the Christofides algorithm.]
- [The output should list the tour as a series of city indices starting and ending at the depot city.]
- [The output should also provide the total travel cost of the tour.]
