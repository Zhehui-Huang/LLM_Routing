- [Requirement 3] Travel cost between cities is calculated using the Euclidean distance.
- [Requirement 4] The output of the program should be the shortest tour starting and ending at the depot city and the total travel cost.
- [Requirement 5] Use the Christofides algorithm to approximate the shortest tour.
