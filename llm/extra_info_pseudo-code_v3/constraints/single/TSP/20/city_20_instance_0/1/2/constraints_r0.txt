- [Requirement 3] The robot is required to visit all cities exactly once and then return to the depot city.
- [Requirement 4] The travel cost between any two cities is determined using Euclidean distance.
- [Requirement 5] The goal is to find the shortest possible tour that meets the traveling requirements.
- [Requirement 6] Output the tour as a list of city indices starting and ending at City 0.
- [Requirement 7] Output the total travel cost of the tour.
- [Requirement 8] The solution should utilize the steps outlined in the Christofides algorithm pseudocode provided.
