- [The environment consists of a total of 10 cities, including a depot city labeled as city 0.]
- [The depot city coordinates are provided as (84, 67).]
- [Coordinates are provided for all cities, including the depot.]
- [Only one robot is used for solving this problem.]
- [The robot must start and end its journey at the depot city 0.]
- [The robot must visit each city exactly once, except for the depot city.]
- [The problem requires finding the shortest complete tour for the robot.]
- [Travel cost between cities is calculated using the Euclidean distance.]
- [The Christofides algorithm is suggested for solving this specific variant of the TSP.]
- [Output should include the tour as a list of city indices starting and ending at the depot city.]
- [Output should also include the total travel cost of the tour.]
