- [There are 15 cities including the depot.]
- [The robot starts at the depot city 0 and returns to it after visiting all other cities.]
- [Each city must be visited exactly once by the robot.]
- [The travel cost is calculated as the Euclidean distance between any two cities.]
- [The goal is to minimize the longest distance between any two consecutive cities in the tour.]
- [Output should include the tour starting and ending at the depot city 0, the total travel cost of the tour, and the maximum distance between any two consecutive cities.]
