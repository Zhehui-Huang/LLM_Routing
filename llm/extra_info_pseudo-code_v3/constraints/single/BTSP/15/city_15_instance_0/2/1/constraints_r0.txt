- [Requirement 1] The robot must visit each city exactly once, starting and ending at the starting depot city 0.
- [Requirement 2] The travel cost is calculated as the Euclidean distance between cities.
- [Requirement 3] The goal is to minimize the longest distance between any two consecutive cities in the tour.
- [Requirement 4] Output the tour as a list of city indices, starting and ending at the depot city 0.
- [Requirement 5] Output the total travel cost of the tour.
- [Requirement 6] Output the maximum distance between any two consecutive cities in the tour.
- [Requirement 7] The pseudocode provided focuses on minimizing the maximum distance between consecutive cities, constructing a graph such that it contains a Hamiltonian path for the least maximum edge weight.
