- [There are 21 nodes in total including the depot city.]
- [Each node represents a city specified as a tuple with coordinates (x, and y).]
- [The robot can travel between any two cities.]
- [Travel cost between cities is calculated as the Euclidean distance between them.]
- [The robot must start and end at the depot city 0.]
- [The robot needs to visit each city exactly once.]
- [The objective is to minimize the longest distance between any two consecutive cities in the tour.]
- [Output the complete tour starting and ending at city 0.]
- [Output the total travel cost of the tour.]
- [Output the maximum distance between any two consecutive cities in the tour.]
