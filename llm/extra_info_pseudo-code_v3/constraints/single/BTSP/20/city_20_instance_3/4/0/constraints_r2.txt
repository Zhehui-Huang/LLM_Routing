- [There are 20 cities including the depot city.]
- [Depot city 0 is the starting and ending point for the robot's tour.]
- [The robot needs to visit each city exactly once in its tour.]
- [The travel distance between any two cities is calculated using the Euclidean distance.]
- [The goal is to minimize the longest distance between any two consecutive cities in the tour.]
- [The algorithm should produce a Hamiltonian path with the maximum edge weight minimized.]
- [Output should include the complete tour, starting and ending at city 0.]
- [Output should list the total travel cost of the tour.]
- [Output should list the maximum distance between any two consecutive cities in the tour.]
