- [There are 10 cities, each designated with a specific coordinate.]
- [There is one robot starting and ending its route at the depot city 0.]
- [The robot must visit each city exactly once.]
- [Travel costs are calculated based on the Euclidean distance between cities.]
- [The goal is to minimize the maximum distance between any two consecutive cities in the robotâ€™s tour.]
- [The output should list the city indices in the order visited, starting and ending at the depot city 0.]
- [The output should include the total travel cost of the tour.]
- [The output should include the maximum distance between any two consecutive cities in the tour.]
