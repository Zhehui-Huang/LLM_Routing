- [Requirement 1] The robot must start and end its tour at the depot city, city 0.
- [Requirement 2] Each city should be visited exactly once by the robot, except for the depot city which must be visited twice (once at the start and once at the end).
- [Requirement 3] The distance measure between any two cities is the Euclidean distance.
- [Requirement 4] The solution should minimize the longest single travel distance between any two consecutive cities in the tour.
- [Requirement 5] Output should include the tour as a list of city indices, starting and ending at city 0.
- [Requirement 6] Output should include the total travel cost of the tour.
- [Requirement 7] Output should include the maximum distance between any two consecutive cities in the tour.
