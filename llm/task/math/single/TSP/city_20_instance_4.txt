Robot information
===
There is one robot.
- The robot start at depot city 0. 
- The robot can travel between any two cities. 
- The travel cost is calculated as the Euclidean distance between the two cities.
###

###
Task
===
The robot needs to visit all cities exactly once, except the depot city, and then return to the depot city.
Please find the shortest tour for the robot.
You can refer to the mathematical formulation provided below to solve the problem:
****
#integer programming formulation

 
Let \( n \) be the number of cities. Let \( c_{ij} \) be the cost of traveling from city \( i \) to city \( j \). Define binary decision variables \( x_{ij} \) such that:
\[
x_{ij} =
\begin{cases}
1 & \text{if the tour goes directly from city } i \text{ to city } j, \\
0 & \text{otherwise}.
\end{cases}
\]

The integer programming formulation for the TSP is as follows:

\[
\begin{aligned}
& \min && \sum_{i=1}^{n} \sum_{j=1}^{n} c_{ij} x_{ij} \\
& \text{s.t.} && \sum_{j=1, j \ne i}^{n} x_{ij} = 1 \quad \forall i = 1, \ldots, n \\
& && \sum_{i=1, i \ne j}^{n} x_{ij} = 1 \quad \forall j = 1, \ldots, n \\
& && \sum_{i, j \in S} x_{ij} \leq |S|-1 \quad \forall S \subset \{1, \ldots, n\}, \ 2 \leq |S| \leq n - 1 \\
& && x_{ij} \in \{0, 1\} \quad \forall i, j = 1, \ldots, n
\end{aligned}
\]

Explanation:
\begin{itemize}
    \item The objective function minimizes the total cost of the tour.
    \item The first set of constraints ensures that each city \( i \) is left exactly once.
    \item The second set of constraints ensures that each city \( j \) is entered exactly once.
    \item The third set of constraints (subtour elimination constraints) ensures that no subtours are formed. 
    %These constraints can be expressed using subtour elimination constraints like the Miller-Tucker-Zemlin (MTZ) constraints for efficiency.
\end{itemize}

###
Format requirements
===
1) Please output the tour as a list of city indices. The tour should start and end at the depot city 0.
2) Please output the total travel cost of the tour.

For example, if the tour is 0 -> 1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 0 and the total travel cost is 100, then the output should be: 

Tour: [0, 1, 2, 3, 0]
Total travel cost: 100
