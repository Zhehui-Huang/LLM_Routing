Robot information
===
There is one robot.
- The robot start at depot city 0. 
- The robot can travel between any two cities. 
- The travel cost is calculated as the Euclidean distance between the two cities.
###

###
Task
===
The robot needs to visit each city exactly once, starting and ending at the depot city. 
The goal is to minimize the longest distance between any two consecutive cities in the tour.
You can use the following mathematical formulation to solve the problem:
****
#integer programming formulation

\[
\begin{aligned}
& \min && \max_{i, j} ~c_{ij} x_{ij} \\
& \text{s.t.} && \sum_{j=1, j \ne i}^{n} x_{ij} = 1 \quad \forall i = 1, \ldots, n \\
& && \sum_{i=1, i \ne j}^{n} x_{ij} = 1 \quad \forall j = 1, \ldots, n \\
& && \sum_{i, j \in S} x_{ij} \leq |S| - 1 \quad \forall S \subset \{1, \ldots, n\}, \ 2 \leq |S| \leq n - 1 \\
& && x_{ij} \in \{0, 1\} \quad \forall i, j = 1, \ldots, n
\end{aligned}
\]

Format requirements
===
1) Please output the tour as a list of city indices. The tour should start and end at the depot city 0.
2) Please output the total travel cost of the tour.
3) Please output the maximum distance between any two consecutive cities in the tour.

For example, if the tour is 0 -> 1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 0, the total travel cost is 100, and the maximum distance between any two consecutive cities is 40, then the output should be: 

Tour: [0, 1, 2, 3, 0]
Total travel cost: 100
Maximum distance between consecutive cities: 40
