Robot Information
===
- Number of robots: 4. Robot id starts from 0.
- Starting location: All robots start at depot city 0.
- Travel capability: Robots can travel between any two cities.
- Travel cost: Calculated as the Euclidean distance between two cities.

Task Description
===
The robots must collectively visit all cities exactly once, excluding the depot city as a destination, and then return to the depot city after completing their tours.
Each robot starts and ends its tour at the depot.
The objective is to determine the shortest possible tours for the robots while minimizing the total travel cost.
Ensure that every city, except the depot, is visited exactly once.
You can use the following mathematical formulation to solve the problem:
****
\begin{itemize}
    \item \( x_{ijk} \): Binary variable that is 1 if salesman \( k \) travels directly from node \( i \) to node \( j \), 0 otherwise.
    \item \( u_i \): Continuous variable representing the position of node \( i \) in the tour.
\end{itemize}


\begin{itemize}
    \item \( c_{ij} \): Cost (distance, time, etc.) associated with traveling from node \( i \) to node \( j \).
    \item \( m \): Number of salesmen.
    \item \( n \): Total number of nodes (including the depot).
\end{itemize}


Minimize the total travel cost:
\[
\min \sum_{i=1}^{n} \sum_{j=1}^{n} \sum_{k=1}^{m} c_{ij} x_{ijk}
\]

\subsection*{Constraints}
1. \textbf{Each city is visited exactly once by one salesman:}
\[
\sum_{i=1}^{n} \sum_{k=1}^{m} x_{ijk} = 1 \quad \forall j = 1, \ldots, n
\]

2. \textbf{Flow conservation constraints (each salesman must leave each visited node and enter each visited node exactly once):}
\[
\sum_{j=1}^{n} x_{ipk} - \sum_{j=1}^{n} x_{pjk} = 0 \quad \forall k = 1, \ldots, m, \; p = 1, \ldots, n
\]

3. \textbf{Each salesman must leave the depot exactly once:}
\[
\sum_{j=1}^{n} x_{1jk} = 1 \quad \forall k = 1, \ldots, m
\]

4. \textbf{Subtour elimination constraints:}
\[
u_i - u_j + n \sum_{k=1}^{m} x_{ijk} \leq n - 1 \quad \forall i \neq j, \; i, j = 2, \ldots, n
\]

5. \textbf{Binary constraints for assignment variables:}
\[
x_{ijk} \in \{0, 1\} \quad \forall i, j = 1, \ldots, n, \; k = 1, \ldots, m
\]

6. \textbf{Continuous variables for node positions:}
\[
u_i \geq 0 \quad \forall i = 2, \ldots, n
\]

Format requirements
===
1) Please output the tours for each robot as a list of city indices. Each tour should start and end at the depot city 0.
2) Please output the total travel cost for each tour and the overall total travel cost.

For example, if there are two robots with the following tours and costs:
Robot 0: 0 -> 1 -> 2 -> 0 with a travel cost of 50
Robot 1: 0 -> 3 -> 4 -> 0 with a travel cost of 60
then the output should be:

Robot 0 Tour: [0, 1, 2, 0]
Robot 0 Total Travel Cost: 50

Robot 1 Tour: [0, 3, 4, 0]
Robot 1 Total Travel Cost: 60

Overall Total Travel Cost: 110
