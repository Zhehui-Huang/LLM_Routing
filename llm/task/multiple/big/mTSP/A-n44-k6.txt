- Starting location: All robots start at depot city 0.
- Travel capability: Robots can travel between any two cities.
- Travel cost: Calculated as the Euclidean distance between two cities.
###

Task
===
The robots need to collectively visit all cities exactly once, except the depot city, and then return to the depot city.
Please find the shortest tours for the robots.

Format requirements
===
1) Please output the tours for each robot as a list of city indices. Each tour should start and end at the depot city 0.
2) Please output the total travel cost for each tour and the overall total travel cost.

For example, if there are two robots with the following tours and costs:
Robot 1: 0 -> 1 -> 2 -> 0 with a travel cost of 50
Robot 2: 0 -> 3 -> 4 -> 0 with a travel cost of 60
then the output should be:

Robot 1 Tour: [0, 1, 2, 0]
Robot 1 Total Travel Cost: 50

Robot 2 Tour: [0, 3, 4, 0]
Robot 2 Total Travel Cost: 60

Overall Total Travel Cost: 110
