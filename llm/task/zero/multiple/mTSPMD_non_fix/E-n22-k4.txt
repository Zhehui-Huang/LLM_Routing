Robot Information
===
- Number of robots: 4. Robot id starts from 0.
- Starting location: All robots start at depot city 0.
- Travel capability: Robots can travel between any two cities.
- Travel cost: Calculated as the Euclidean distance between two cities.
###

###
Task Description
===
The robots need to collectively visit all cities exactly once.
Each robot starts from a designated depot but does not need to return to the depot after completing its tour.
The robots can stop at any city as their endpoint.
The goal is to determine the shortest tours for each robot while minimizing the total travel cost for all robots combined.
Ensure that each city is visited exactly once and that the tours are optimized for the lowest total travel distance or cost.
###

###
Format requirements
===
1) Please output the tours for each robot as a list of city indices. Each tour should start and end at its assigned depot.
2) Please output the total travel cost for each tour and the overall total travel cost.

For example, if there are two robots with the following tours and costs:
Robot 0 (Depot 0): 0 -> 2 -> 3 -> 0 with a travel cost of 50
Robot 1 (Depot 1): 1 -> 4 -> 5 -> 1 with a travel cost of 60
then the output should be:

Robot 0 Tour: [0, 2, 3, 0]
Robot 0 Total Travel Cost: 50

Robot 1 Tour: [1, 4, 5, 1]
Robot 1 Total Travel Cost: 60

Overall Total Travel Cost: 110
