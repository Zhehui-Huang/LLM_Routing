Adaptations of Lin-Kernighan Heuristic for Generalized Traveling Salesman Problem (GTSP)

Authors: D. Karapetyan, G. Gutin

Key Insights:

1. Background on GTSP:
   - In GTSP, unlike traditional TSP, the goal is to visit exactly one vertex from each cluster. This problem has practical applications in logistics such as warehouse order picking and courier routing.

2. Lin-Kernighan Heuristic:
   - Originally designed for TSP, Lin-Kernighan is one of the most effective heuristics for solving it. Its adaptability to GTSP is explored, maintaining its effectiveness and adjusting for the problem's complexity through specialized adaptations.

3. Adaptation Strategies:
   - Discusses multiple adaptation strategies, focusing on adjusting the heuristic to handle sets of vertices (clusters) instead of individual vertices.

4. Experimental Validation:
   - Various adaptations of the Lin-Kernighan heuristic are tested against established GTSP benchmarks. The adaptations show promising results, often outperforming other heuristics.

5. Algorithm Complexity and Performance:
   - The adaptations are designed to be efficient, with a focus on minimizing the increase in computational complexity introduced by the cluster-based problem structure of GTSP.

6. Practical Implications and Future Work:
   - The successful adaptation suggests potential for further research in other complex routing and optimization problems. Future work will explore refining these adaptations and expanding their applicability.

This approach not only enhances understanding of heuristic optimizations for GTSP but also provides a robust framework for tackling similar logistics and distribution challenges.

Format requirements
===
1) Please output the tour as a list of city indices. The tour should start and end at the depot city 0.
2) Please output the total travel cost of the tour.

For example, if the tour is 0 -> 1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 0 and the total travel cost is 100, then the output should be: 

Tour: [0, 1, 2, 3, 0]
Total travel cost: 100
