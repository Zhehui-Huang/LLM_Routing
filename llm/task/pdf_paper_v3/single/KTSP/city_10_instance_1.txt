Robot information
===
There is one robot.
- The robot start at depot city 0. 
- The robot can travel between any two cities. 
- The travel cost is calculated as the Euclidean distance between the two cities.
###

###
Task
===
The robot needs to visit exactly 5 cities, including the depot city, starting and ending at the depot city.
The goal is to find the shortest possible tour that visits exactly 5 cities out of the given set of cities.
You can refer to the insights provided below to solve the problem.

Two Multi-Start Heuristics for the k-Traveling Salesman Problem

Authors: Venkatesh Pandiri, Alok Singh

Key Insights:

1. k-TSP Overview:
   - The k-TSP seeks a minimum length tour starting and ending at the home city, visiting exactly k out of n cities.
   - Relevant in scenarios with limited resources to visit all cities, such as distribution network design and rural healthcare delivery.

2. Multi-Start GVNS Approach:
   - Utilizes a variable neighborhood descent (VND) with two neighborhood structures focused on subset selection and permutation.
   - Demonstrates effectiveness across a range of instances, minimizing complexity through targeted local searches.

3. Multi-Start Hyper-Heuristic Approach:
   - Combines two low-level heuristics: one for subset selection and another for permutation, adapting to problem characteristics dynamically.
   - Offers a versatile and adaptive solution framework capable of handling diverse problem instances.

4. Computational Results:
   - The HH approach generally outperformed the GVNS approach in benchmark tests, showing superior adaptability and solution quality.
   - Benchmark instances were derived from TSPLIB, tailored to demonstrate the effectiveness of the methods.

5. Practical Implications and Future Work:
   - These heuristic approaches provide robust frameworks for k-TSP and similar logistical challenges.
   - Future studies could explore the integration of these heuristics with other metaheuristic frameworks to enhance solution quality further.

This document provides a comprehensive analysis of the proposed heuristics for k-TSP, offering insights into their practical applications and potential for future research enhancements.

Format requirements
===
1) Please output the tour as a list of city indices. The tour should start and end at the depot city 0.
2) Please output the total travel cost of the tour.

For example, if the tour is 0 -> 1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 0 and the total travel cost is 100, then the output should be: 

Tour: [0, 1, 2, 3, 0]
Total travel cost: 100
