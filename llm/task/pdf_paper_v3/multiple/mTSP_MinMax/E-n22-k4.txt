Robot Information
===
- Number of robots: 4. Robot id starts from 0.
- Starting location: All robots start at depot city 0.
- Travel capability: Robots can travel between any two cities.
- Travel cost: Calculated as the Euclidean distance between two cities.
###

###
Task Description
===
The robots must collectively visit all cities exactly once, excluding the depot city as a destination, and then return to the depot city after completing their tours.
Each robot starts and ends its tour at the depot.
The primary objective is to minimize the maximum distance traveled by any single robot.
Ensure that every city, except the depot, is visited exactly once.
You can refer to the insights provided below to solve the problem.

Advanced Heuristic for MinMax mTSP: ITSHA

Authors: Jiongzhi Zheng, Yawei Hong, Wenchang Xu, Wentao Li, Yongfu Chen

Abstract:
The ITSHA is designed to optimize the mTSP with both MinSum and MinMax objectives. It consists of an initialization stage to generate diverse initial solutions and an improvement stage applying Variable Neighborhood Search (VNS) to refine these solutions. The algorithm demonstrates superior performance compared to state-of-the-art heuristics.

Key Insights:

1. Algorithm Structure:
   - Initialization Stage: Utilizes fuzzy c-means (FCM) clustering and random greedy heuristics to create initial solutions that are diverse and of high quality.
   - Improvement Stage: Employs VNS with custom local search neighborhoods to optimize solutions, incorporating methods to escape local optima.

2. Performance and Evaluation:
   - Tested on a wide range of public benchmark instances, ITSHA significantly outperforms existing heuristics on both MinSum and MinMax objectives.
   - Demonstrates effectiveness in real-world applications like traffic signalization, showcasing substantial route optimization.

3. Novel Components:
   - Introduces new local search operators (2-opt, Insert, and Swap) tailored for mTSP, providing a deeper and more effective exploration of the solution space.
   - Applies a candidate set approach to each city to narrow down the search scope and improve the efficiency of the neighborhoods.

4. Practical Relevance and Future Work:
   - The algorithm's adaptability to both objectives makes it highly relevant for complex logistic applications.
   - Future enhancements could include further refining the heuristic elements and exploring its application to other complex routing problems.

These insights affirm ITSHA's robust capability in handling complex mTSP scenarios, significantly enhancing route optimization and efficiency.

Format requirements
===
1) Please output the tours for each robot as a list of city indices. Each tour should start and end at the depot city 0.
2) Please output the travel cost for each tour and the maximum travel cost among all tours.

For example, if there are two robots with the following tours and costs:
Robot 0: 0 -> 1 -> 2 -> 0 with a travel cost of 50
Robot 1: 0 -> 3 -> 4 -> 0 with a travel cost of 60
then the output should be:

Robot 0 Tour: [0, 1, 2, 0]
Robot 0 Total Travel Cost: 50

Robot 1 Tour: [0, 3, 4, 0]
Robot 1 Total Travel Cost: 60

Maximum Travel Cost: 60
