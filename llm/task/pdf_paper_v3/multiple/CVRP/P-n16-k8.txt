Task Description
===
The robots must collectively deliver goods to all cities, excluding the depot city, and then return to the depot city after completing their deliveries.
Each robot has a specified carrying capacity.
Each city has a specific demand that must be met.
The objective is to determine the shortest possible tours for the robots while ensuring that:
- The demand of each city is fully met.
- The capacity constraints of the robots are not exceeded.
Minimize the total travel cost for all tours.
You can refer to the insights provided below to solve the problem.

Insights from "A Novel Heuristic Algorithm for CVRP"

Authors: Sena Kır, Harun Reşit Yazgan, Emre Tüncel

Key Insights:

1. Algorithm Overview:
   - Combines tabu search and adaptive large neighborhood search (ALNS) to address the complexity of CVRP, effective in large-scale scenarios.
   - Incorporates custom-designed destroy/repair operators that consider both route sequence and vehicle capacity.

2. Performance on Benchmarks:
   - Demonstrates superior performance on benchmark problems, providing solutions quickly and efficiently with competitive accuracy.
   - Notably effective in reducing computational time compared to existing methods.

3. Real-World Application:
   - Successfully applied to a real-life CVRP for a company in Sakarya, Turkey, leading to significant operational improvements.
   - Comparative analysis showed that the heuristic outperforms the company's previous methods, highlighting its practical viability and efficiency.

4. Special Features:
   - Features innovative methods such as a relocation procedure that adjusts routes based on proximity and capacity constraints.
   - Utilizes a movement list to avoid cycling and enhance the diversity of solutions explored.

5. Theoretical Contributions:
   - Supports infeasible intermediate solutions, broadening the search space and potentially leading to better final solutions.
   - Employs an adaptive memory and flexible parameter settings to optimize performance dynamically based on the problem's characteristics.

6. Implementation and Results:
   - Detailed implementation results show that the algorithm performs well against known benchmarks, improving on the best-known solutions for several instances.

This structured approach not only enhances understanding of heuristic optimizations for CVRP but also provides a robust framework for tackling similar logistics and distribution challenges.

Format Requirements
===
1) Please output the tours for each robot as a list of city indices. Each tour should start and end at the depot city 0.
2) Please output the total travel cost for each tour and the overall total travel cost.
3) Ensure that the demand of each city is met and the capacity constraints of each robot are not violated.

For example, if there are two robots with the following tours and costs:
Robot 0: 0 -> 1 -> 2 -> 0 with a travel cost of 50
Robot 1: 0 -> 3 -> 4 -> 0 with a travel cost of 60
then the output should be:

Robot 0 Tour: [0, 1, 2, 0]
Robot 0 Total Travel Cost: 50

Robot 1 Tour: [0, 3, 4, 0]
Robot 1 Total Travel Cost: 60

Overall Total Travel Cost: 110
