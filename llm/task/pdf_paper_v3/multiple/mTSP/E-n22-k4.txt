Robot Information
===
- Number of robots: 4. Robot id starts from 0.
- Starting location: All robots start at depot city 0.
- Travel capability: Robots can travel between any two cities.
- Travel cost: Calculated as the Euclidean distance between two cities.
###

###
Task Description
===
The robots must collectively visit all cities exactly once, excluding the depot city as a destination, and then return to the depot city after completing their tours.
Each robot starts and ends its tour at the depot.
The objective is to determine the shortest possible tours for the robots while minimizing the total travel cost.
Ensure that every city, except the depot, is visited exactly once.
You can refer to the insights provided below to solve the problem.

Generalized k-Opt Exchange Procedure for the mTSP

Authors: Jean-Yves Potvin, Guy Lapalme, Jean-Marc Rousseau

Abstract:
This paper introduces a technique that generalizes the classical k-opt exchange by allowing exchanges that lead to the partition of a single tour into multiple subtours, which are then merged back into an equivalent single tour. This method enhances the k-opt procedure by expanding the set of exchange opportunities, which is particularly effective for mTSP problems with time windows.

Key Features of the Generalized k-Opt Procedure:
1. Generalized k-Changes:
   - Considers "generalized" k-changes, which involve splitting a tour into multiple subtours. These subtours are feasible if each contains at least one copy of the depot, offering more exchange opportunities.

2. Feasibility of New Solutions:
   - New solutions are feasible if at least one copy of the depot is included in each subchain, allowing more complex changes than traditional methods.

3. Advantages Over Classical Methods:
   - This generalized approach is shown to be more powerful than the classical k-opt due to its ability to consider a broader range of potential solutions.

4. Performance with Time Windows:
   - Particularly advantageous for mTSP with time windows, as it accommodates constraints more effectively than traditional methods.

5. Numerical Results:
   - Presents numerical results demonstrating the effectiveness of this method on both classical mTSP and mTSP with time windows, showing significant improvements over existing solutions.

Conclusion:
The generalized k-opt exchange procedure provides a robust framework for solving mTSP problems, offering substantial improvements, especially in cases with additional constraints like time windows.

Format requirements
===
1) Please output the tours for each robot as a list of city indices. Each tour should start and end at the depot city 0.
2) Please output the total travel cost for each tour and the overall total travel cost.

For example, if there are two robots with the following tours and costs:
Robot 0: 0 -> 1 -> 2 -> 0 with a travel cost of 50
Robot 1: 0 -> 3 -> 4 -> 0 with a travel cost of 60
then the output should be:

Robot 0 Tour: [0, 1, 2, 0]
Robot 0 Total Travel Cost: 50

Robot 1 Tour: [0, 3, 4, 0]
Robot 1 Total Travel Cost: 60

Overall Total Travel Cost: 110
