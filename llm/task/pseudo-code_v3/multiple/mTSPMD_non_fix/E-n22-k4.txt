- Starting location: All robots start at depot city 0.
- Travel capability: Robots can travel between any two cities.
- Travel cost: Calculated as the Euclidean distance between two cities.

Task Description
===
The robots need to collectively visit all cities exactly once.
Each robot starts from a designated depot but does not need to return to the depot after completing its tour.
The robots can stop at any city as their endpoint.
The goal is to determine the shortest tours for each robot while minimizing the total travel cost for all robots combined.
Ensure that each city is visited exactly once and that the tours are optimized for the lowest total travel distance or cost.
You can use the following pseudocode to solve the problem:
****
\subsection{Initial Solution}
An initial solution is necessary for any Tabu Search (TS) algorithm to start the local search process. The quality of this initial solution significantly affects the performance of the TS heuristic.

\textbf{Heuristic Algorithm (NNS)}: Based on nearest neighborhood search to find the initial solution.
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Randomly select a starting depot for each tour and allocate the nearest city until all depots are connected to one city.
    \item Allocate the nearest city to the last city in each tour until all cities are allocated.
    \item Allocate the last city in each tour to the nearest finishing depot.
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Neighborhood Structure}
Various neighborhood structures are applied to generate neighbor solutions from the current solution. These structures are based on the 2-interchange generation mechanism and include combinations of vertex reassignment, vertex swap, 2-opt moves, and ‘tails swap’ between two tours.

\textbf{Move Operators}:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{Relocate Operator}: Move a city from one tour to another.
    \item \textbf{Exchange Operator}: Swap two cities between tours.
    \item \textbf{Tail-swap Operator}: Swap the tails of two tours.
    \item \textbf{Depot-exchange Operator}: Exchange starting/ending depots between tours.
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Tabu List}
The tabu list keeps track of recently made moves or visited solutions to prevent cycling and encourage exploration of new areas in the search space.

\textbf{Attributes}: The list contains fitness function attributes of solutions during the last 10-15 iterations.

\textbf{Management}: The tabu status of the last fitness function performed is added to the list, while others are decreased by one until zero.

\subsection{Stopping Criterion}
The search terminates if either a specified number of iterations have elapsed in total or since the last best solution was found.

\subsection{Intra Exchanging Phase}
This phase improves the current solution by exchanging pairs of nodes within individual tours.

\textbf{Operation}: Similar to the exchange operator but applied within the same tour, choosing the best exchange between two nodes.

\subsection{The TS Algorithm}
The proposed TS algorithm uses a Pareto principle for acceptance of neighbor solutions, ensuring solutions are non-dominated.

\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{Initialization}:
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item Set iteration index \(i\) and consecutive iterations without change \(c\) to 0.
        \item Generate initial solution \(X_0\) with NNS and create \(p-1\) solutions with relocate operator to form the Pareto list.
        \item Set the best solution as \(X_{\text{best}}\) and the worst solution as the current solution.
    \end{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{Main Loop}:
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item Repeat until maximum iterations or tabu list is empty:
        \begin{enumerate}
            \item Select a neighborhood move operator randomly.
            \item Generate a new solution from the current solution.
            \item If the new solution is better and not tabu, update the current solution and tabu list, and reset \(c\).
            \item If no improvement after \(v\) consecutive iterations, perform intra exchanging phase.
            \item If no change after maximum consecutive iterations, eliminate the current solution and select the worst solution in the Pareto list as the current solution.
        \end{enumerate}
    \end{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{Diversification}: Stochastic neighborhood selection among four types of moves and varying tabu length introduces diversification.
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Pseudo Code}
\begin{verbatim}
Set i and c equal to 0;
Generate initial solution X0 with NNS;
Generate p - 1 solutions from X0 with relocate operator and set these p solutions as Pareto list;
Set the best solution in the list as Xbest and the worst solution as the current solution;
Repeat
  Select one of the four types of neighborhood move operator randomly;
  Generate one solution by the selected move operator from the current solution;
  If the new solution is not tabu and better, update the current solution and tabu list, set i = i + 1 and c = 0;
  Otherwise, set c = c + 1;
  If (c mod v == 0), perform intra exchanging phase;
  If (c > mc), eliminate current solution from the list and set the worst solution in the list as the current solution;
Until (i <= m) and tabu list is not empty;
\end{verbatim}

Format requirements
===
1) Please output the tours for each robot as a list of city indices. Each tour should start and end at its assigned depot.
2) Please output the total travel cost for each tour and the overall total travel cost.

For example, if there are two robots with the following tours and costs:
Robot 0 (Depot 0): 0 -> 2 -> 3 -> 0 with a travel cost of 50
Robot 1 (Depot 1): 1 -> 4 -> 5 -> 1 with a travel cost of 60
then the output should be:

Robot 0 Tour: [0, 2, 3, 0]
Robot 0 Total Travel Cost: 50

Robot 1 Tour: [1, 4, 5, 1]
Robot 1 Total Travel Cost: 60

Overall Total Travel Cost: 110
