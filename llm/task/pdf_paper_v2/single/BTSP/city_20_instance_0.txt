Robot information
===
There is one robot.
- The robot start at depot city 0. 
- The robot can travel between any two cities. 
- The travel cost is calculated as the Euclidean distance between the two cities.
###

###
Task
===
The robot needs to visit each city exactly once, starting and ending at the depot city. 
The goal is to minimize the longest distance between any two consecutive cities in the tour.
You can refer to the insights provided below to solve the problem.

Guaranteed Performance Heuristics for the Bottleneck Traveling Salesman Problem (BTSP)

Authors: R. Gary Parker and Ronald L. Rardin

Key Insights:

1. Problem Definition:
   - The Bottleneck Traveling Salesman Problem (BTSP) seeks to minimize the maximum edge cost in a Hamiltonian cycle of a graph.

2. Algorithmic Feasibility:
   - No polynomial-time, constant-performance-bound algorithm can exist for BTSP with arbitrary costs unless P=NP.

3. Heuristic Development:
   - For graphs with positive costs adhering to the triangle inequality, a polynomial-time heuristic with a worst-case performance bound of 2 is developed.

4. Algorithmic Approach:
   - The algorithm, named Algorithm BT, operates by:
     1. Generating a bottleneck-optimal biconnected subgraph.
     2. Tracing a Hamiltonian cycle in the square of this subgraph to approximate the optimal tour for BTSP.

5. Performance Bounds:
   - Under the triangle inequality condition, the heuristic guarantees that the maximum edge cost of the solution is at most twice the optimal value.

6. Theoretical Contributions:
   - Leverages properties of biconnected graphs and the concept of graph squaring, providing a methodologically interesting solution.

7. Implications for Further Research:
   - Suggests potential for further improvements in heuristic design or problem constraints could potentially lower the bound of 2.

These insights offer a structured approach to tackling the BTSP, useful under specific graph conditions, contributing to heuristic algorithm design for combinatorial optimization problems.

Format requirements
===
1) Please output the tour as a list of city indices. The tour should start and end at the depot city 0.
2) Please output the total travel cost of the tour.
3) Please output the maximum distance between any two consecutive cities in the tour.

For example, if the tour is 0 -> 1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 0, the total travel cost is 100, and the maximum distance between any two consecutive cities is 40, then the output should be: 

Tour: [0, 1, 2, 3, 0]
Total travel cost: 100
Maximum distance between consecutive cities: 40
