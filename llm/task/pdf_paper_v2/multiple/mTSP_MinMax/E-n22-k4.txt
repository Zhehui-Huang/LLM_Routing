Robot Information
===
- Number of robots: 4. Robot id starts from 0.
- Starting location: All robots start at depot city 0.
- Travel capability: Robots can travel between any two cities.
- Travel cost: Calculated as the Euclidean distance between two cities.
###

###
Task Description
===
The robots must collectively visit all cities exactly once, excluding the depot city as a destination, and then return to the depot city after completing their tours.
Each robot starts and ends its tour at the depot.
The primary objective is to minimize the maximum distance traveled by any single robot.
Ensure that every city, except the depot, is visited exactly once.
You can refer to the insights provided below to solve the problem.

Insights from "A General Variable Neighborhood Search Heuristic for mTSP"

Authors: Banu Soylu

Abstract:
This study proposes a general variable neighborhood search heuristic for the mTSP, focusing on minimizing the longest tour length (MinMax mTSP) and the total length of all tours (MinSum mTSP). The effectiveness of this heuristic is demonstrated through tests on literature benchmarks and a real-world application in Kayseri, Turkey, showcasing significant improvements in route optimization.

Key Insights:

1. Heuristic Design:
   - Adapts variable neighborhood search mechanisms for mTSP, using multiple neighborhood structures to optimize solutions.

2. MinMax vs. MinSum Objectives:
   - Addresses both objectives but emphasizes MinMax to balance the workload among salesmen, suitable for equitable route distribution.

3. Real-World Application:
   - Applied to the traffic signalization network in Kayseri, effectively rebalanced tour lengths, leading to more consistent workload distribution.

4. Performance Evaluation:
   - Demonstrated superior performance over existing methods, particularly in reducing the longest tour length, showing efficiency and adaptability.

5. Future Directions:
   - Suggests enhancing the heuristic's efficiency and exploring its applicability to other complex routing and scheduling problems.

These insights provide a solid foundation for understanding the application and benefits of the GVNS heuristic in solving MinMax mTSP problems, offering significant operational improvements in logistics and distribution systems.

Format requirements
===
1) Please output the tours for each robot as a list of city indices. Each tour should start and end at the depot city 0.
2) Please output the travel cost for each tour and the maximum travel cost among all tours.

For example, if there are two robots with the following tours and costs:
Robot 0: 0 -> 1 -> 2 -> 0 with a travel cost of 50
Robot 1: 0 -> 3 -> 4 -> 0 with a travel cost of 60
then the output should be:

Robot 0 Tour: [0, 1, 2, 0]
Robot 0 Total Travel Cost: 50

Robot 1 Tour: [0, 3, 4, 0]
Robot 1 Total Travel Cost: 60

Maximum Travel Cost: 60
