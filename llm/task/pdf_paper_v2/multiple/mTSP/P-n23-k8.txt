Robot Information
===
- Number of robots: 8. Robot id starts from 0.
- Starting location: All robots start at depot city 0.
- Travel capability: Robots can travel between any two cities.
- Travel cost: Calculated as the Euclidean distance between two cities.
###

Task Description
===
The robots must collectively visit all cities exactly once, excluding the depot city as a destination, and then return to the depot city after completing their tours.
Each robot starts and ends its tour at the depot.
The objective is to determine the shortest possible tours for the robots while minimizing the total travel cost.
Ensure that every city, except the depot, is visited exactly once.
You can refer to the insights provided below to solve the problem.

Advanced Heuristic Algorithms for mTSP

Key Features of the Discussed Algorithms:

1. Heuristic Approaches:
   - Various heuristic methods such as genetic algorithms, tabu search, and simulated annealing are applied to mTSP. These methods are adapted to handle multiple salesmen, aiming to minimize the total distance traveled and balance the load among salesmen.

2. Hybrid Techniques:
   - Combines different heuristic strategies to exploit the strengths of each, leading to better convergence and solution quality. Integrating genetic algorithms with local search techniques improves exploration and exploitation capabilities.

3. Performance Evaluations:
   - The algorithms are rigorously tested against benchmark datasets. Results indicate that hybrid heuristics often outperform traditional single-method approaches in terms of solution quality and computational efficiency.

4. Practical Applications:
   - mTSP solvers are crucial in logistics and distribution, where multiple deliveries or services must be conducted efficiently. The discussed algorithms show significant potential in optimizing routes for fleets of vehicles in a logistic network.

5. Future Directions:
   - Suggests potential enhancements in algorithmic strategies and the incorporation of machine learning techniques to predict and adapt to dynamic conditions in real-time applications.

These insights provide a solid foundation for further research and application in solving mTSP with advanced heuristic methods, offering significant benefits in logistics and distribution optimization tasks.

Format requirements
===
1) Please output the tours for each robot as a list of city indices. Each tour should start and end at the depot city 0.
2) Please output the total travel cost for each tour and the overall total travel cost.

For example, if there are two robots with the following tours and costs:
Robot 0: 0 -> 1 -> 2 -> 0 with a travel cost of 50
Robot 1: 0 -> 3 -> 4 -> 0 with a travel cost of 60
then the output should be:

Robot 0 Tour: [0, 1, 2, 0]
Robot 0 Total Travel Cost: 50

Robot 1 Tour: [0, 3, 4, 0]
Robot 1 Total Travel Cost: 60

Overall Total Travel Cost: 110
