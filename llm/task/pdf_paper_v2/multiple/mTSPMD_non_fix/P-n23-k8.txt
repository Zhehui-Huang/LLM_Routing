Robot Information
===
- Number of robots: 8. Robot id starts from 0.
- Starting location: All robots start at depot city 0.
- Travel capability: Robots can travel between any two cities.
- Travel cost: Calculated as the Euclidean distance between two cities.

Task Description
===
The robots need to collectively visit all cities exactly once.
Each robot starts from a designated depot but does not need to return to the depot after completing its tour.
The robots can stop at any city as their endpoint.
The goal is to determine the shortest tours for each robot while minimizing the total travel cost for all robots combined.
Ensure that each city is visited exactly once and that the tours are optimized for the lowest total travel distance or cost.
You can refer to the insights provided below to solve the problem.

Comparative Study of Meta-heuristic Algorithms for Non-fixed Destination Multi-depot mTSP

Authors: Fereydoun Adbesh, Kamran Kardel

Abstract:
This study addresses the non-fixed destination multi-depot mTSP, where salesmen depart from multiple depots and are not required to return to their original starting cities, but the number of cities in each depot remains consistent. The paper evaluates the computational performance and theoretical properties of three meta-heuristic algorithms—Genetic Algorithms (GAs), Simulated Annealing (SA), and Tabu Search (TS)—against optimal solutions derived from Lingo 8 software.

Key Insights:

1. Algorithm Overview:
   - Genetic Algorithms (GAs): Utilizes custom chromosome designs and operators like crossover and mutation tailored for mTSP.
   - Simulated Annealing (SA): Adapts by allowing worse moves to escape local optima, with a cooling schedule to guide the solution process.
   - Tabu Search (TS): Employs memory structures to avoid revisiting recent solutions, enhancing the exploration of the solution space.

2. Performance Evaluation:
   - SA and TS demonstrated solutions close to the optimal, particularly effective in medium to very large-sized problems.
   - GAs were less effective compared to SA and TS but still offered competitive solutions in larger setups.

3. Practical Applications:
   - These algorithms are crucial for complex logistics and distribution challenges involving multiple depots where route optimization significantly impacts efficiency and cost.

4. Computational Efficiency:
   - SA offered the fastest solutions with considerable accuracy.
   - TS was noted for its robustness and ability to find high-quality solutions, especially in larger scenarios.

5. Future Directions:
   - Further refinement of these meta-heuristics could explore integrating machine learning techniques to adapt dynamically to varying problem conditions.

These insights underline the effectiveness of advanced heuristic methods in solving complex routing problems like the non-fixed destination multi-depot mTSP, demonstrating significant improvements in operational efficiencies.

Format requirements
===
1) Please output the tours for each robot as a list of city indices. Each tour should start and end at its assigned depot.
2) Please output the total travel cost for each tour and the overall total travel cost.

For example, if there are two robots with the following tours and costs:
Robot 0 (Depot 0): 0 -> 2 -> 3 -> 0 with a travel cost of 50
Robot 1 (Depot 1): 1 -> 4 -> 5 -> 1 with a travel cost of 60
then the output should be:

Robot 0 Tour: [0, 2, 3, 0]
Robot 0 Total Travel Cost: 50

Robot 1 Tour: [1, 4, 5, 1]
Robot 1 Total Travel Cost: 60

Overall Total Travel Cost: 110
