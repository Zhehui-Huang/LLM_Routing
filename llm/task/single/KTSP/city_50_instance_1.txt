Robot information
===
There is one robot.
- The robot start at depot city 0. 
- The robot can travel between any two cities. 
- The travel cost is calculated as the Euclidean distance between the two cities. 

###
Task
===
The robot needs to visit exactly 15 cities, excluding the depot city, starting and ending at the depot city.
The goal is to find the shortest possible tour that visits exactly 15 cities out of the given set of cities.

Format requirements
===
1) Please output the tour as a list of city indices. The tour should start and end at the depot city 0.
2) Please output the total travel cost of the tour.

For example, if the tour is 0 -> 1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 0 and the total travel cost is 100, then the output should be: 

Tour: [0, 1, 2, 3, 0]
Total travel cost: 100
