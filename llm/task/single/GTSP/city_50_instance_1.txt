- The robot start at depot city 0. 
- The robot can travel between any two cities.

The robot needs to visit at least one city from each group of cities, starting and ending at the depot city.
Please find the shortest tour for the robot.

Format requirements
===
1) Please output the tour as a list of city indices. The tour should start and end at the depot city 0.
2) Please output the total travel cost of the tour.

For example, if the tour is 0 -> 1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 0 and the total travel cost is 100, then the output should be: 

Tour: [0, 1, 2, 3, 0]
Total travel cost: 100
