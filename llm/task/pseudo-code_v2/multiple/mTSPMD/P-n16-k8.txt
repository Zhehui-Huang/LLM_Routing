Task Description
===
The robots must collectively visit all cities exactly once and then return to their respective depots.
Each robot starts and ends at its assigned depot.
The objective is to determine the shortest possible tours for each robot while minimizing the total travel cost for all robots combined.
Ensure that each city is visited exactly once, and each robot returns to its starting depot after completing its tour.
You can refer to the pseudocode provided below to solve the problem:

\subsection*{Initialization}
\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{Parameters Setup}: The algorithm starts by initializing several parameters:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item \textit{antnum}: Number of artificial ants.
        \item \textit{cyclenum}: Number of successive cycles with no improvement in the best solution before termination.
        \item \textit{inittrail}: Initial amount of pheromone on the paths.
        \item \textit{$\alpha$ (alpha)}: Parameter to control the influence of pheromone trails.
        \item \textit{$\beta$ (beta)}: Parameter to control the influence of heuristic information.
        \item \textit{$\rho$ (rho)}: Evaporation rate of the pheromone.
    \end{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Pheromone Initialization}: All pheromone values $\tau_{ij}$ on the paths are set to \textit{inittrail}.
\end{enumerate}

\subsection*{Main Cycle}
The algorithm operates in cycles, where each cycle consists of the following steps:

\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{Solution Construction}:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Each of the \textit{antnum} ants constructs a solution.
        \item Each ant starts from a randomly selected depot and constructs a tour by choosing the next city based on a transition probability until returning to the starting depot.
        \item \textbf{Transition Probability}: The probability $p_{ij}^k$ that ant $k$ moves from city $i$ to city $j$ is given by:
        \[
        p_{ij}^k = \begin{cases}
        \frac{[\tau_{ij}(t)]^\alpha [\eta_{ij}]^\beta}{\sum_{k \in \text{allowed}_k} [\tau_{ik}(t)]^\alpha [\eta_{ik}]^\beta} & \text{if } j \in \text{allowed}_k \\
        0 & \text{otherwise}
        \end{cases}
        \]
        Here, \textit{allowed\_k} is the set of cities that ant $k$ has not yet visited, $\tau_{ij}(t)$ is the pheromone value on the path from $i$ to $j$ at time $t$, and $\eta_{ij}$ is the heuristic information, typically the inverse of the distance between cities $i$ and $j$.
        
        \item \textbf{Special Cases for Transition Probability}: Modifications are made to avoid infeasible solutions:
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Ant returns to the depot if it has visited the maximum allowed cities $L$.
            \item Ant returns to the depot if continuing would prevent subsequent tours from satisfying the minimum number of cities $K$.
        \end{itemize}
    \end{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Trail Update}:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item After all ants have constructed their solutions, the pheromone trails are updated.
        \item \textbf{Evaporation}: Pheromone on all paths is reduced by a factor of $\rho$:
        \[
        \tau_{ij} \leftarrow (1 - \rho) \tau_{ij}
        \]
        \item \textbf{Pheromone Addition}: Pheromone is added to the paths that were used by the ants. If $F_k$ is the objective function value (e.g., inverse of the tour length) for ant $k$, then:
        \[
        \tau_{ij} \leftarrow \tau_{ij} + \sum_{k=1}^{antnum} \Delta \tau_{ij}^k
        \]
        where:
        \[
        \Delta \tau_{ij}^k = \begin{cases}
        F_k & \text{if ant } k \text{ uses path } (i,j) \\
        0 & \text{otherwise}
        \end{cases}
        \]
    \end{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Stopping Criterion}: The cycle repeats until there is no improvement in the best solution for \textit{cyclenum} successive cycles.
\end{enumerate}

\subsection*{Algorithm Termination}
Once the stopping criterion is met, the algorithm returns the best solution found during the cycles.

Format requirements
===
1) Please output the tours for each robot as a list of city indices. Each tour should start and end at its assigned depot.
2) Please output the total travel cost for each tour and the overall total travel cost.

For example, if there are two robots with the following tours and costs:
Robot 0 (Depot 0): 0 -> 2 -> 3 -> 0 with a travel cost of 50
Robot 1 (Depot 1): 1 -> 4 -> 5 -> 1 with a travel cost of 60
then the output should be:

Robot 0 Tour: [0, 2, 3, 0]
Robot 0 Total Travel Cost: 50

Robot 1 Tour: [1, 4, 5, 1]
Robot 1 Total Travel Cost: 60

Overall Total Travel Cost: 110
