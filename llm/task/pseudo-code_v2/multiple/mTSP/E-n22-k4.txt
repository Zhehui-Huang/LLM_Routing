Robot Information
===
- Number of robots: 4. Robot id starts from 0.
- Starting location: All robots start at depot city 0.
- Travel capability: Robots can travel between any two cities.
- Travel cost: Calculated as the Euclidean distance between two cities.

Task Description
===
The robots must collectively visit all cities exactly once, excluding the depot city as a destination, and then return to the depot city after completing their tours.
Each robot starts and ends its tour at the depot.
The objective is to determine the shortest possible tours for the robots while minimizing the total travel cost.
Ensure that every city, except the depot, is visited exactly once.
You can use the following pseudocode to solve the problem:

The MTOUR algorithm addresses the Multiple Traveling Salesmen Problem (mTSP), where multiple salesmen must cover different routes starting and ending at a common depot, with the objective of minimizing the total distance traveled.

\section*{Detailed Summary}

\subsection*{1. Initialization}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Define the number of salesmen \( m \).
    \item Initialize the set of cities \( C \) and the common depot.
    \item Choose a starting point for each salesman at the depot.
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{2. Subroutine: Assignment of Cities}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Distribute cities among the salesmen using a heuristic approach to ensure an initial feasible solution.
    \item The assignment aims to balance the workload among the salesmen, considering proximity to the depot.
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{3. Subroutine: Tour Construction}
\begin{itemize}
    \item For each salesman, construct an initial tour using a heuristic like the nearest neighbor or a greedy algorithm.
    \item This step creates an initial path for each salesman starting and ending at the depot.
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{4. Subroutine: Tour Improvement}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Apply local search techniques such as 2-opt or 3-opt to improve the individual tours.
    \item These techniques involve iteratively improving the tour by reversing the order of cities in a segment to reduce the total travel distance.
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{5. Subroutine: Inter-Salesmen Optimization}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Optimize the assignment of cities between salesmen by exploring possible reassignments that can lead to a lower total distance.
    \item Techniques like swap or relocate are used to move cities between different salesmen's tours to achieve a more optimal solution.
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{6. Termination}
\begin{itemize}
    \item The algorithm terminates when no further improvements can be made through local or inter-salesmen optimizations.
    \item The final solution consists of \( m \) optimized tours, one for each salesman, covering all cities.
\end{itemize}

\section*{Detailed Steps}

\subsection*{1. Initialization}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Set the number of salesmen \( m \).
    \item Identify and assign the common depot as the starting point for each salesman.
    \item Initialize the set of cities \( C \) excluding the depot.
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{2. Assignment of Cities}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Use a heuristic to divide the remaining cities among the salesmen. This could be based on geographic clustering or other distance measures.
    \item Ensure each salesman has a roughly equal number of cities to visit, considering the proximity to the depot.
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{3. Tour Construction}
\begin{itemize}
    \item For each salesman, create an initial tour:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Begin at the depot.
        \item Select the next city to visit based on the nearest neighbor heuristic or another greedy method.
        \item Continue until all assigned cities are visited and return to the depot.
    \end{itemize}
    \item This results in an initial feasible tour for each salesman.
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{4. Tour Improvement}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Apply local search methods to each salesman's tour:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item \textbf{2-opt:} Evaluate pairs of edges and reverse segments to find a shorter tour.
        \item \textbf{3-opt:} Consider three edges at a time and rearrange to reduce the tour length.
    \end{itemize}
    \item Iteratively apply these improvements until no further reduction in tour length is possible.
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{5. Inter-Salesmen Optimization}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Explore potential improvements by moving cities between salesmen's tours:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item \textbf{Swap:} Exchange cities between two salesmen's tours and check for improvement.
        \item \textbf{Relocate:} Move a city from one salesman's tour to another and evaluate the impact on total distance.
    \end{itemize}
    \item Perform these operations iteratively to achieve a better overall solution.
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{6. Termination}
\begin{itemize}
    \item The algorithm stops when no further improvements can be made through intra-tour or inter-tour optimizations.
    \item The final solution is a set of \( m \) optimized tours that collectively cover all cities with minimized total travel distance.
\end{itemize}

Format requirements
===
1) Please output the tours for each robot as a list of city indices. Each tour should start and end at the depot city 0.
2) Please output the total travel cost for each tour and the overall total travel cost.

For example, if there are two robots with the following tours and costs:
Robot 0: 0 -> 1 -> 2 -> 0 with a travel cost of 50
Robot 1: 0 -> 3 -> 4 -> 0 with a travel cost of 60
then the output should be:

Robot 0 Tour: [0, 1, 2, 0]
Robot 0 Total Travel Cost: 50

Robot 1 Tour: [0, 3, 4, 0]
Robot 1 Total Travel Cost: 60

Overall Total Travel Cost: 110
