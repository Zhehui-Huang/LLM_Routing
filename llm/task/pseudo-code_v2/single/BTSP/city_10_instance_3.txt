Robot information
===
There is one robot.
- The robot start at depot city 0. 
- The robot can travel between any two cities. 
- The travel cost is calculated as the Euclidean distance between the two cities.
###

###
Task
===
The robot needs to visit each city exactly once, starting and ending at the depot city. 
The goal is to minimize the longest distance between any two consecutive cities in the tour.
You can refer to the pseudocode provided below to solve the problem:

#heuristic algorithm


\textbf{Input:} A weighted complete graph $G(V, E)$ with edge weights $c_{ij}$.

\textbf{Steps:}

\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{Bottleneck-optimal Biconnected Subgraph (Step 1):}
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item Apply Algorithm BB to obtain $G(V, E_{BB})$, a bottleneck-optimal biconnected subgraph of $G$.
        \item \textbf{Algorithm BB:}
        \begin{enumerate}
            \item \textbf{Step 0 (Initialization):} 
            \begin{itemize}
                \item Sort the edges $E$ in non-decreasing order of their weights $c_{ij}$.
                \item Initialize the solution set $E_{BB}$ as an empty set.
            \end{itemize}
            \item \textbf{Step 1 (Augmentation):}
            \begin{itemize}
                \item Select the next edge in order from the sorted list and add it to $E_{BB}$.
            \end{itemize}
            \item \textbf{Step 2 (Stopping Condition):}
            \begin{itemize}
                \item Check if $G(V, E_{BB})$ is biconnected.
                \item If it is, compute $c_{BB} = \max \{c_{ij} : (i, j) \in E_{BB} \}$ and stop.
                \item If not, repeat Step 1.
            \end{itemize}
        \end{enumerate}
    \end{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{Tour Identification (Step 2):}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Identify an approximate optimal tour for BTSP by tracing a Hamiltonian cycle $T$ in the square $G^2(V, E_{BB}^2)$ of the biconnected subgraph obtained in Step 1.
        \item Define $c_T = \max \{c_{ij} : (i, j) \in T \}$.
    \end{itemize}
\end{enumerate}

\textbf{Output:} An approximate solution to BTSP with the bottleneck cost $c_T$.

Format requirements
===
1) Please output the tour as a list of city indices. The tour should start and end at the depot city 0.
2) Please output the total travel cost of the tour.
3) Please output the maximum distance between any two consecutive cities in the tour.

For example, if the tour is 0 -> 1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 0, the total travel cost is 100, and the maximum distance between any two consecutive cities is 40, then the output should be: 

Tour: [0, 1, 2, 3, 0]
Total travel cost: 100
Maximum distance between consecutive cities: 40
