Robot information
===
There is one robot.
- The robot start at depot city 0. 
- The robot can travel between any two cities. 
- The travel cost is calculated as the Euclidean distance between the two cities.
###

###
Task
===
The robot needs to visit all cities exactly once, except the depot city, and then return to the depot city.
Please find the shortest tour for the robot.
You can refer to the pseudocode provided below to solve the problem:
****
Lin-Kernighan algorithm


Input: A graph G with a cost function c, and an initial tour T.
Output: An improved tour T'.

1. Initialize:
   a. Set best gain g* := 0
   b. Set best set of edges F := ∅
   c. Push all vertices u in V(G) with (u, 0, 0) onto the stack

2. Main Loop:
   Repeat until no improvement is found:
   a. Set current tour gain g := 0
   b. While the stack is not empty:
      i. Pop (u, i, g) from the stack
      ii. If i is even:
         For each v in V(G) such that (v_i, u) is in T:
            Push (u, i + 1, g + c(v_i, u)) onto the stack
      iii. If i is odd:
         If g > c(v_i, v_0):
            Report a closed alternating trail with gain g - c(v_i, v_0)
         For each u in V(G) such that g > c(v_i, u):
            Push (u, i + 1, g - c(v_i, u)) onto the stack
      iv. If g* > 0:
         Update T := T Δ F
         Clear the stack
      v. If i > backtracking depth:
         Pop all elements with depth > backtracking depth from the stack
   c. If no improvement found, stop

3. Return the improved tour T'

Format requirements
===
1) Please output the tour as a list of city indices. The tour should start and end at the depot city 0.
2) Please output the total travel cost of the tour.

For example, if the tour is 0 -> 1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 0 and the total travel cost is 100, then the output should be: 

Tour: [0, 1, 2, 3, 0]
Total travel cost: 100
