Robot Information
===
- Number of robots: 3. Robot id starts from 0.
- Starting location: All robots start at depot city 0.
- Travel capability: Robots can travel between any two cities.
- Travel cost: Calculated as the Euclidean distance between two cities.
###

###
Task
===
The robots need to collectively visit all cities exactly once, except the depot city, and then return to the depot city.
Please minimize the maximum distance traveled by any single robot.
###

###
Format requirements
===
1) Please output the tours for each robot as a list of city indices. Each tour should start and end at the depot city 0.
2) Please output the travel cost for each tour and the maximum travel cost among all tours.

For example, if there are two robots with the following tours and costs:
Robot 0: 0 -> 1 -> 2 -> 0 with a travel cost of 50
Robot 1: 0 -> 3 -> 4 -> 0 with a travel cost of 60
then the output should be:

Robot 0 Tour: [0, 1, 2, 0]
Robot 0 Total Travel Cost: 50

Robot 1 Tour: [0, 3, 4, 0]
Robot 1 Total Travel Cost: 60

Maximum Travel Cost: 60
