Robot Information
===
- Number of robots: 5. Robot id starts from 0.
- The capacity of each robot: 100
- Starting location: All robots start at depot city 0.
- Travel capability: Robots can travel between any two cities.
- Travel cost: Calculated as the Euclidean distance between two cities.
###

###
Task Description
===
The robots need to collectively deliver goods to all cities, except the depot city, and then return to the depot city.
Each robot has the same carrying capacity.
Each city has a specific demand that must be met.
Please find the shortest tours for the robots while ensuring that:
- The demand of each city is met.
- The capacity constraints of the robots are not violated.
Minimize the total travel cost for all tours.
###

###
Format Requirements
===
1) Please output the tours for each robot as a list of city indices. Each tour should start and end at the depot city 0.
2) Please output the total travel cost for each tour and the overall total travel cost.
3) Ensure that the demand of each city is met and the capacity constraints of each robot are not violated.

For example, if there are two robots with the following tours and costs:
Robot 0: 0 -> 1 -> 2 -> 0 with a travel cost of 50
Robot 1: 0 -> 3 -> 4 -> 0 with a travel cost of 60
then the output should be:

Robot 0 Tour: [0, 1, 2, 0]
Robot 0 Total Travel Cost: 50

Robot 1 Tour: [0, 3, 4, 0]
Robot 1 Total Travel Cost: 60

Overall Total Travel Cost: 110
