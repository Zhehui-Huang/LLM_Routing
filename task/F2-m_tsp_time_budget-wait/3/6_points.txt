There are several places of interest on the plane.
['Place 1: (9, 4)',
 'Place 2: (4, 6)',
 'Place 3: (4, 4)',
 'Place 4: (3, 4)',
 'Place 5: (4, 8)',
 'Place 6: (4, 3)',
].
All robots start and end at Place 1.
Each robot can travel between any two distinct places, but can not travel from its current place to the same place.
The travel cost is determined by the Euclidean distance between two locations.
Each robot only has one tour.
Each place can be visited by any robot only once, except the starting location.
Every robot has a velocity of 1 unit per minute and is limited to one tour.
Every robot can stop at a place and wait any time they want before go to the next place.

Task: I have three robots visit all places cooperatively.
Place 2, 3, 4, 5 must be visited before 12 minutes.
Your goal is to provide a solution which makes the maximum distance traveled by any robot is minimized.
If the robot stop at a place and wait for a specific time, you need to print the waited time.
