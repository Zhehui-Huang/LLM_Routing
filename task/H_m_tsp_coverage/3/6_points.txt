There are several places of interest on the plane.  
['Place 1: (9, 4)',
 'Place 2: (4, 6)',
 'Place 3: (4, 4)',
 'Place 4: (3, 4)',
 'Place 5: (4, 8)',
 'Place 6: (4, 3)',
].
- All robots start and end at Place 1.
- Each robot can move between any two distinct locations, including the possibility of moving from its current location back to itself.
- The travel cost is determined by the Euclidean distance between two locations.
- Each robot only has one tour.
- The time taken for each robot to travel between locations is considered uniform, regardless of the distance.
- A robot is considered connected to another if they are within 5 units of distance.
- Robots must remain within 5 units of distance from each other to be considered connected. This connection can be direct or indirect, with connectivity being a transitive property.
- All robots must have same movement steps.
- All robots move simultaneously.

Task: I have three robots visit all places cooperatively.
All places must be visited at least once.
The connectivity constraint should be obeyed at every movement step.
The maximum distance traveled by any robot is minimized.
