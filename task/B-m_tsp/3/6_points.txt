There are several places of interest on the plane.
['Place 1: (9, 4)',
 'Place 2: (4, 6)',
 'Place 3: (4, 4)',
 'Place 4: (3, 4)',
 'Place 5: (4, 8)',
 'Place 6: (4, 3)',
].
All robots start and end at Place 1.
Each robot can travel between any two distinct places, but can not travel from its current place to the same place.
The travel cost is determined by the Euclidean distance between two locations.
Each robot only has one tour.
Each place can be visited by any robot only once, except the starting location.

Task: I have three robots visit all places cooperatively.
The maximum distance traveled by any robot is minimized.
