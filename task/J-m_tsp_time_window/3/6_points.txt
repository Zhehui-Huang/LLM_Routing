There are several places of interest on the plane.
['Place 1: (9, 4)',
 'Place 2: (4, 6)',
 'Place 3: (4, 4)',
 'Place 4: (3, 4)',
 'Place 5: (4, 8)',
 'Place 6: (4, 3)',
].
The depot of all robots is Place 1.
Each robot can travel between any two distinct places, but can not travel from its current place to the same place.
The travel cost is determined by the Euclidean distance between two locations.
There are five customers who need to be served.
Each customer has a time window [a, b] defining the earliest and latest service start time.
Each customer has a start location and a destination location.

Customer 1: time window [7, 10], start location Place 2, destination location Place 3.
Customer 2: time window [6, 8], start location Place 4, destination location Place 5.
Customer 3: time window [10, 18], start location Place 6, destination location Place 5.
Customer 4: time window [5, 15], start location Place 6, destination location Place 2.
Customer 5: time window [2, 12], start location Place 3, destination location Place 1.

Each customer is visited exactly once by exactly one vehicle.
Each robot only has one tour.
Each robot can only serve one customer at a time.
For each robot, waiting time is allowed.

Task: I have three robots to serve customers cooperatively.
The solution should aim to minimize the total distance traveled by all robots.
