There are several places of interest on the plane.
['Place 1: (9, 4)',
 'Place 2: (4, 6)',
 'Place 3: (4, 4)',
 'Place 4: (3, 4)',
 'Place 5: (4, 8)',
 'Place 6: (4, 3)',
].
All robots start and end at Place 1.
Each robot can travel between any two distinct places, but can not travel from its current place to the same place.
The travel cost is determined by the Euclidean distance between two locations.
Each robot only has one tour.
Each place can be visited by any robot only once, except the starting location.
Every robot has a velocity of 1 unit per minute and is limited to one tour.

Task: I have three robots visit all places cooperatively.
The task is to use three robots to visit as many distinct places as possible, with the constraint that the total travel time does not exceed 15 minutes.
Your goal is to provide a solution that maximizes the number of distinct places visited within the 15-minute time budget.
