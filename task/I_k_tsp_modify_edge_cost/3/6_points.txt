There are several places of interest on the plane.
The coordinates of these places are as follows:
['Place 1: (9, 4)',
 'Place 2: (4, 6)',
 'Place 3: (4, 4)',
 'Place 4: (3, 4)',
 'Place 5: (4, 8)',
 'Place 6: (4, 3)',
].
The distance between any two places is the NOT based on Euclidean distance.
The default distance between any two places is 3 units, except for specific connections with different costs as follows:

The distance between Place 1 and Place 2 is 1 unit.
The distance between Place 2 and Place 3 is 1 unit.
The distance between Place 3 and Place 4 is 1 unit.
The distance between Place 4 and Place 5 is 1 unit.
The distance between Place 5 and Place 6 is 1 unit.
The distance between Place 2 and Place 4 is 1 unit.
The distance between Place 3 and Place 5 is 1 unit.
The distance between Place 1 and Place 6 is 2 units.

All robots start and end at Place 1.
Each robot can travel between any two distinct places, but can not travel from its current place to the same place.
Each robot only has one tour.

Task: I have three robots visit the places cooperatively.
All robots start and end at Place 1.
Robots will visit places as long as the shortest distance between the place and the start place is less than or equal to 2.
The objective is to find an optimal solution where the longest tour length among all robots is minimized.
