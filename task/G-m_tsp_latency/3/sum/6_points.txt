There are several places of interest on the plane.
['Place 1: (9, 4)',
 'Place 2: (4, 6)',
 'Place 3: (4, 4)',
 'Place 4: (3, 4)',
 'Place 5: (4, 8)',
 'Place 6: (4, 3)',
].
All robots start at Place 1.
Robots can travel directly between any two distinct places, excluding self-visits.
The cost of travel is defined by the Euclidean distance between locations.
Every robot has a velocity of 1 unit per minute and is limited to one tour.

Task: I have three robots visit all places cooperatively.
The primary goal is to assign routes to three robots such that they cooperatively cover all places of interest,
with a particular focus on minimizing the sum the latency time of all places.
Latency time is defined as the time gap before first visiting the place.
