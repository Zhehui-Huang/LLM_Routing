There are several places of interest on the plane.  
['Place 1: (9, 4)',
 'Place 2: (4, 6)',
 'Place 3: (4, 4)',
 'Place 4: (3, 4)',
 'Place 5: (4, 8)',
 'Place 6: (4, 3)',
 'Place 7: (7, 5)',
 'Place 8: (5, 0)']
All robots start and end at Place 1. The robot can travel between any two places, except itself. 
The travel cost is the distance between two places. 
Each robot only has one tour.

Task: I have three robots visit all places cooperatively. 
There is only one tour for each robot. 
Each robot start and end at place 1. 
We assume all robots move at the same time and have the same movement velocity. 
I want to make the longest tour length of all robots as small as possible.
